<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>CINDERELLA AT HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SHE did not know that she was a Cinderella,
as she knelt on the floor putting on Miss
Ada Marsh’s satin slippers. She had
never even thought of such a possibility, and if
any one had mentioned it to her she would have
opened her big brown eyes very wide, and felt
inclined to regard the suggestion as a rather foolish
joke. In her own humble opinion she was
not a person of the very least importance, being
only little Gretel Schiller, whom nobody seemed
to care very much about, and who lived with Mrs.
Marsh, because there didn’t seem to be any other
place for her to live. It seemed to her quite natural
that she should make herself useful in the
family, considering—as Mrs. Marsh frequently
reminded her—that her half-brother, who lived
in China, paid very inadequately for her support.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
But this evening her heart was beating fast and
she was regarding Miss Ada Marsh with more
interest than usual for was not that young lady
actually going to fairy-land?</p>

<p>The slippers were small, and Miss Ada’s feet
were large, so that the task of getting them on
was a more difficult one than might have been at
first supposed.</p>

<p>“Aren’t they—aren’t they just a little tight?”
gasped Gretel, when several unsuccessful attempts
had failed to produce the desired result.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” responded Ada, with decision.
“Just push the heel in more. There, that’s better.
They do pinch a little, but that’s only because
they’re new. They’ll be perfectly comfortable
as soon as I’ve stretched them.” And
Ada rose, and limped painfully across the room
to the bureau.</p>

<p>“There, I believe I’m ready now, except my
gloves. You can button them for me, and then
just run and see if Mamma needs any help. It’s
ten minutes to eight, and they always begin those
long German operas promptly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t be late. It would be terrible
to miss any of it,” said Gretel, anxiously.
She was drawing a long white kid glove up over
Miss Marsh’s plump arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>Ada shrugged her shoulders indifferently.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind missing a little,” she said.
“All the Wagner operas are so long and so heavy.
I wish Mr. Pendleton had asked us to go to the
theater instead. There’s the door-bell; it must
be Mr. Pendleton. My goodness! these slippers
do need stretching. I’m thankful the opera house
is just across the street; do hurry and finish
Mamma. That Dora is so stupid about hooking
her up. We mustn’t keep Mr. Pendleton
waiting.”</p>

<p>Gretel hurried away wondering. It seemed
very strange that any one could talk about going
to fairy-land as Ada did, but then she was only
eleven, and there were a great many things in
the world that she did not understand. As she
was crossing the narrow hall of the apartment
to Mrs. Marsh’s room, Dora, the maid-of-all-work,
opened the front door, and a young man
in a dress-suit stepped in, and greeted the little
girl good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Good evening, little Miss Gretchen,” he said,
with a smile. “Are your cousins ready? Your
name is Gretchen, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“My name is Margareta Schiller,” said Gretel,
drawing herself up with the little air of dignity
that always amused grown-up people. “They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
call me Gretel, not Gretchen. Ada’s nearly
ready, and I’m going to see if I can help Mrs.
Marsh with the hooks; but they’re not my
cousins.”</p>

<p>“Not your cousins, eh? Why, I thought—”
But Mr. Pendleton did not say what he thought,
for at that moment Mrs. Marsh’s door opened,
and that lady appeared, carrying her evening
wrap over her arm.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Pendleton, just in time,” she said,
smiling, and speaking in what Gretel always
called “her company voice.” “Gretel, darling,
run and tell Ada, Mr. Pendleton is here. We
must not lose a moment; it would be too sad to
miss that beautiful overture.”</p>

<p>As Gretel turned away to do as she was told,
Mr. Pendleton followed her rather curiously with
his eyes.</p>

<p>“What a pretty child,” he remarked in a low
voice to Mrs. Marsh. “I supposed she was a
relative of yours, but she says she is not.”</p>

<p>“No, she is not a relative, but it was a most
natural mistake for any one to make. It is
rather complicated to explain. My dear husband
was a cousin of Gretel’s mother’s first husband.
She is an orphan, poor little girl, and her only
relative—a half-brother—has been living in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Hong-Kong for several years. I give her a home,
and Ada and I do all in our power to make her
happy, but in our straitened circumstances it is
scarcely possible for us to be as generous as we
should like.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marsh sighed, and Mr. Pendleton looked
sympathetic, and murmured something about being
sure the little girl had a very happy home,
but just then Gretel reappeared, followed by Ada,
who was still struggling with the last button of
her glove.</p>

<p>“Good night, Gretel dear,” said Mrs. Marsh,
sweetly, as she stepped into the elevator. “Don’t
sit up too long reading fairy stories, but go to
bed early, like a good girl.”</p>

<p>“Ada wants me to sit up till she comes home,”
began Gretel, but on receiving a warning glance
from Miss Marsh, she grew suddenly pink and
did not finish her sentence.</p>

<p>“Good night, Miss Margareta,” said Mr.
Pendleton, pleasantly, as he followed the others
into the elevator. “Your time will come, too,
some day, and we shall have you going to the
opera before we know it.”</p>

<p>Then the elevator door closed, and Gretel was
left standing alone in the hall. But unlike the
Cinderella of fairy-tale fame, she did not sit down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
among the ashes to cry. On the contrary, she
smiled quite brightly, as she closed the door of
the Marshes’ apartment, and hurried away to the
parlor, the windows of which looked down on
Broadway, and over at the great opera house
just across the street.</p>

<p>Gretel was still smiling when she pushed aside
the window-curtains, and flattened her face
against the pane. To watch the people going
into fairy-land was one of her favorite amusements.</p>

<p>“I wonder whether I really ever shall go,”
she said to herself a little wistfully. “I don’t
quite see how I can, for of course nobody will
ever take me, and it costs so much money to buy
a ticket, even for the standing-up place. But,
oh, if I should—it would be something to be
happy about forever!”</p>

<p>It was very interesting to watch the long line
of carriages and motor-cars depositing their occupants
at the doors of fairy-land. Gretel
watched them eagerly, but for the first time a
little doubt had crept into her mind.</p>

<p>“I used to think they must all be so happy,”
she said, reflectively, “but Ada didn’t seem to
care much, and I don’t believe Mrs. Marsh did,
either, though she pretended to. Father said a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
person must have a soul to love music, and I
don’t believe Mrs. Marsh or Ada have souls—or
at least not the kind he meant.”</p>

<p>Just then some one came into the room and
turned up the light. It was Dora, the maid-of-all-work.
For the first moment she did not see
Gretel, who was hidden by the curtains of the
window, and going over to the center table, she
lifted the lid of a candy box, and was just about
to help herself to a caramel when she caught
sight of the little girl, and flew back hastily, with
a muttered ejaculation of annoyance. But Gretel
was too much absorbed to notice what the maid
was doing.</p>

<p>“Come and watch them go in, Dora,” she said,
eagerly. “There are more carriages and automobiles
than ever to-night, I think. That’s because
it’s ‘Lohengrin.’ Father loved ‘Lohengrin’
best of all the operas; he used to play it
for me. I know the ‘Swan Song,’ and ‘Elsa’s
Dream’ and the wedding march. I can play little
bits of them myself. Did you ever go to fairy-land,
Dora?”</p>

<p>“Fairy-land!” Dora repeated, laughing.
“What a funny question! Of course I didn’t.
There isn’t any such place really; it’s just in
stories.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“I didn’t mean to call it that,” explained
Gretel, blushing. “I meant to say the opera.
Father and I used to call it fairy-land because
he loved it so, and I always call it that to myself.
Father took me there once, and it was so beautiful.
I’m sure the fairy-land they tell about in
books couldn’t be any more beautiful. We sat
away up in the top gallery, so it didn’t cost so
very much. It was Father’s birthday, and he
thought he would give us both a treat, but he
was sorry afterwards, because a friend of his
came the next day to ask to borrow some money,
and he hadn’t any to give him. Father was so
kind; he was always giving his money away to
people. Mrs. Marsh says that was why there
wasn’t any more money left for me when he
died, but I’m glad he was like that; all his friends
loved him so much.”</p>

<p>“Has your father been dead long?” Dora
asked, with a glance at the child’s shabby black
dress.</p>

<p>“He died a year ago this winter, just after
Christmas. He was very ill on Christmas, but
he would get up and light the Christmas tree.
You see, Father was German, and in Germany
every one has a Christmas tree. We always had
one, even when there wasn’t much to put on it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
I didn’t know how ill Father was, and I cried
because he wouldn’t sit up and tell me stories.
You see, we lived all alone in the studio, and
there wasn’t anybody grown-up to take care of
Father, and make him stay in bed when he was
ill. But the day after Christmas he was so much
worse that he couldn’t get out of bed at all and
then Fritz Lipheim came and brought a doctor.”</p>

<p>“Who was Fritz Lipheim?” inquired Dora,
who was beginning to be interested, and had
seated herself comfortably on the sofa.</p>

<p>“He was a German, too,” said Gretel; “almost
all Father’s friends were German. Fritz played
the violin beautifully, but he wasn’t nearly as
clever as Father.”</p>

<p>“What did your father do?” Dora wanted
to know.</p>

<p>Gretel’s eyes opened wide in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know?” she demanded incredulously.
“I thought everybody knew about
Father. He was Hermann Schiller the great
pianist. I don’t believe anybody in the world
ever played the piano like Father. He used to
play at concerts, and crowds of people came to
hear him. He might have been rich, only all his
friends were so poor he had to keep giving them
money. Everybody loved him. My mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
loved him so much that she gave up her beautiful
home, and all the money her first husband had
left her, just to marry him and take care of him.
She wouldn’t let him give away all his money,
but she died when I was only four, and after that
there wasn’t any one to take care of Father but
me.”</p>

<p>“And what relation are you to Mrs. Marsh?”
inquired Dora, who had been in the family only
a few weeks.</p>

<p>“I’m not any relation at all to her. Mr.
Marsh was a cousin of my mother’s first husband,
Mr. Douane, but I never knew her till after
my father died. You see, when the doctor told
Father he was going to die, he was dreadfully
worried, because he didn’t know what was going
to become of me. He asked Fritz Lipheim to
telegraph to my half-brother in China. My
brother was very kind. He telegraphed back
that Father wasn’t to worry, and afterwards he
arranged with Mrs. Marsh to have me live with
her. I have to be very grateful, Mrs. Marsh
says, because if he hadn’t been willing to support
me, I would have had to go to an orphan asylum.
The Lipheims would have taken care of me, only
they are very poor, and sometimes they don’t
have enough money to pay the rent, so when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
Mrs. Marsh came and said I was to live with
her, they were very much relieved. That was the
day after Father’s funeral, and I was so very
unhappy I didn’t care where I went.”</p>

<p>“And was Mrs. Marsh good to you?” Dora
inquired rather skeptically.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; she and Ada were both very kind
that day. Ada gave me chocolates, and Mrs.
Marsh explained how good my brother was, and
how fortunate it was that I didn’t have to go to
an asylum.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that was much,” remarked
Dora. “A nice sort of man your brother would
have been if he had let you be sent to an asylum.
Is he very poor?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, he isn’t poor at all. When Mother
married Father all the money her first husband
had left her went to her son. I heard Mrs.
Marsh tell a lady all about it. Then after
Mother died my brother went to live with his
grandfather in Virginia, and when his grandfather
died he left him all his money, too. He
is a great deal older than I; he was fourteen when
Mother married Father. He used to come to
see us sometimes when I was little, and brought
Father and me beautiful presents, but I don’t
remember him very well, because he went to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
China when I was only six. But of course I’m
very grateful to him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t see anything to be so everlastingly
grateful about,” objected Dora. “But say,
don’t you want to play me a tune? I love to
hear you play.”</p>

<p>Gretel sprang to her feet with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you really want to hear me play?” she
demanded, incredulously. “I didn’t suppose anybody
cared about it. I’m afraid I’ve forgotten
most of the things Father taught me, and Mrs.
Marsh won’t let me touch the piano when she is
at home. She says the noise makes her nervous.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad,” said Dora, sympathetically;
“you do play so lovely, and if you had lessons,
why, my goodness, you might get to be a great
musician like your papa. I don’t suppose Mrs.
Marsh would let you take lessons. If she would
I know an awful nice young man who’s a real
high-class music teacher. He plays the piano at
a moving-picture theater, and he’s been giving
my sister Lillie lessons. I don’t believe he’d
charge very high.”</p>

<p>Gretel’s face clouded for a moment, and she
shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Marsh won’t let me,” she said, with
a sigh. “She says my brother only sends a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
little money. That’s why I try to do things for
Ada, to help pay my board.”</p>

<p>Dora gave vent to her feelings by an indignant
sniff.</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s why you don’t go to school,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; my brother sends the money for my
education, but Mrs. Marsh didn’t happen to know
of any good school, so her sister Miss Talcott,
who used to teach in a school, said she would give
me lessons every afternoon. I used to go to her
apartment every day till January, but then a
friend invited her to go to California, so I don’t
have any lessons now. Miss Talcott is very nice
and I liked having lessons with her, but she has
a great many engagements and quite often she had
to be out all the afternoon. I didn’t mind much,
because she used to let me stay and play on her
piano, and I loved that.”</p>

<p>“Well, come along and give us a tune now,”
said Dora, good-naturedly, and Gretel from whose
face the momentary cloud had vanished, left her
seat in the window, and hastened to open the
piano.</p>

<p>It was true that Gretel had forgotten much of
the music her father had taught her. It was
more than a year since the musical education from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
which poor Hermann Schiller had hoped such
great things, had come to a sudden standstill.
But Gretel still played remarkably well for a child
of her age, and as her fingers wandered lovingly
over the keys of Mrs. Marsh’s rather cracked
piano, a strange, rapt look came into her face,
and for the moment everything else in the world
was forgotten. Dora, secure in the knowledge
that the family could not return for several hours,
curled herself up comfortably on the parlor sofa.
But Dora, though fond of music of a certain
kind, was not quite up to Chopin and Mendelssohn,
and as Gretel played on and on, a sensation
of comfortable drowsiness began to steal over her,
and ere long her eyes had closed, and she was
fast asleep.</p>

<p>Serenely unconscious of this fact Gretel played
on, now a bit of one half-forgotten melody, now
another, and as she played she forgot her present
surroundings—forgot that she was no longer
the child pianist, to whom her father’s friends
had listened with astonishment and pride—but
only a poor little Cinderella left alone in her
shabby black frock, while Mrs. Marsh and her
daughter went to fairy-land. She seemed to see
again the big, half-furnished studio, that had once
been home, and Hermann Schiller and his German<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
friends, smoking their pipes as they listened to
her playing, always ready with a burst of applause
when her father called out in his kind cheery
voice, “Enough for to-night, Liebchen—time to
give one of the others a turn.” It all seemed so
real that for one moment she glanced up, half
expecting to see the familiar scene, and the row
of kindly, interested faces, but it was only Mrs.
Marsh’s shabby little parlor, with Dora fast
asleep on the sofa. Suddenly a great wave of
homesickness swept over the little girl—the
music stopped with a crash and dropping her face
on the piano keys, Gretel began to cry.</p>

<p>At the sudden pause in the music Dora opened
her eyes, and sat up with a start. The next moment
she had sprung to her feet.</p>

<p>“Whatever are you crying about?” she demanded
in astonishment. “I thought you liked
to play.”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” sobbed Gretel. “I think
it must be the music. I love it so, and—and I
never hear any now. I’m forgetting everything
Father taught me, and he would be so unhappy
if he knew.”</p>

<p>“There, there, I wouldn’t cry about it if I was
you,” soothed Dora, laying a kind hand on one of
the child’s heaving shoulders. “It’s too bad, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
I’m real sorry for you, but maybe we can manage
for you to hear some music if you’re so crazy
about it. My sister Lillie has a lovely voice, and
she’d be real glad to come and sing for you some
time, I know. My little brother Peter plays the
piano, too, though he’s never had a lesson in his
life. Music just seems to come to him natural,
and he makes up things as he goes along.
Father’s going to try and get him into vaudeville.”</p>

<p>Gretel dried her eyes; she was beginning to
be interested.</p>

<p>“I should love to hear him,” she said, “and
your sister, too. Do you think Mrs. Marsh would
let me?”</p>

<p>Dora looked a little doubtful.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” she admitted. “She’s
got awful fussy notions about girls having company,
even their own relations. But I’ll tell you
what we might do. Mrs. Marsh and Miss Ada
are both going out to dinner to-morrow night and
I might get the kids to come round and play for
you while they’re out. They’d be real proud to
have the chance to show off.”</p>

<p>“It would be very pleasant indeed,” agreed
Gretel, “only—only do you think we ought to
have them if Mrs. Marsh objects?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>Dora reddened indignantly.</p>

<p>“If Mrs. Marsh wants to keep a decent girl,
she’s got to let her have a little liberty,” she declared
defiantly. “If anybody can show me
where the harm is in my having my little sister
and brother to spend the evening with me, I’d
like to have them do it. Nobody’s going to do
any harm, and a person’s got to have a little
amusement once in a while. I’ve been in this
house nearly six weeks, and not a living soul have
I had to see me since I came.”</p>

<p>“I’m quite sure Father wouldn’t have minded,”
said Gretel; “he always wanted people to be
happy, but Mrs. Marsh isn’t the least like
Father.”</p>

<p>“I should say she wasn’t. Why, what pleasure
do you ever have yourself, you poor little thing?
It’s nothing but run errands and wait on that
lazy Miss Ada from morning till night. It makes
me sick, that’s what it does. But you’re going to
have a little fun this time, and don’t you forget
it. I’m going right off this minute to send a
postal to Lillie, to tell her and Peter to come
round here and play and sing to you to-morrow
evening.”</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when Mrs. Marsh and
her daughter reached home. Mrs. Marsh was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
tired and sleepy, and she was not speaking in
her “company voice” as she let herself in with
her latch key, and switched on the electric light.</p>

<p>“Really, Ada, I am surprised at you. You
might at least have let Mr. Pendleton think you
enjoyed it.”</p>

<p>“I was bored to death, and I suppose I couldn’t
help showing it,” returned her daughter, with a
yawn. “I never pretended to care for music,
and I don’t see why he didn’t take us to the
theater. There are half a dozen plays I’m dying
to see. I hope that child hasn’t gone to bed, and
forgotten my chocolate.”</p>

<p>“Really, Ada,” remonstrated her mother, “you
ought not to keep Gretel up so late. It isn’t good
for her, and I expressly told her to go to bed
early.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense; it doesn’t hurt her a bit. Besides,
she loves it. All children adore sitting up after
they are supposed to be in bed.”</p>

<p>Before Mrs. Marsh could say any more, a door
at the back of the apartment opened, and a little
figure appeared, carrying a cup of hot chocolate
on a tray. Gretel’s cheeks were flushed, and her
eyes were shining; she did not look in the least
sleepy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“It’s all ready,” she announced cheerfully. “I
heard the man calling the carriages, so I knew
‘Lohengrin’ was finished, and I went and made it
right away. It’s nice and hot.”</p>

<p>Ada gave a satisfied nod.</p>

<p>“Take it to my room,” she said; “you can stay
and brush my hair while I drink it.”</p>

<p>“She must do no such thing,” objected Mrs.
Marsh, who was looking both worried and annoyed.
“Gretel, didn’t you hear me tell you to
go to bed early?”</p>

<p>Gretel glanced from Mrs. Marsh to her daughter,
and her grave little face was troubled.</p>

<p>“I know you did,” she said, slowly, “but Ada
told me to stay up and make the chocolate. I did
go to sleep on the sofa after Dora went to bed,
but I set the alarm-clock for half-past eleven, so
as to be sure to wake in time. I’m sorry if it
was wrong, Mrs. Marsh, but it’s very hard to
know which I ought to mind, you or Ada.”</p>

<p>Gretel had no intention of being impertinent;
she was merely stating a puzzling fact, which she
frequently found very troublesome. But Mrs.
Marsh reddened angrily.</p>

<p>“That is not the proper way for a little girl to
speak,” she began, but her daughter cut her short.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“Oh, for pity’s sake, don’t begin a lecture at
this time of night, Mamma. We are all much too
tired to argue. Come with me, Gretel.”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Marsh, who was a weak woman,
and who was, moreover, considerably afraid of
her tall, domineering daughter, made no further
objections, but retired in silence to her own room.</p>

<p>“How did you enjoy yourself all the evening?”
Ada inquired, good-naturedly, as she sipped
her chocolate, while Gretel brushed out her long
hair. “I hope you weren’t lonely.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Gretel, cheerfully; “I had a
very pleasant time. First I watched the people
going into fairy—I mean the opera, and then
Dora came and talked to me, and I played on the
piano. Mrs. Marsh doesn’t mind my playing
when she’s out. I ought to be very grateful to
Mrs. Marsh, oughtn’t I?”</p>

<p>Ada laughed.</p>

<p>“You funny little thing,” she said; “I never
heard a child ask such questions. I suppose you
ought to be grateful to Mamma, but what made
you think of it?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t quite know,” faltered Gretel,
blushing. “I was only wondering about something
Dora said. Oughtn’t it to give people
pleasure to be grateful?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“Of course it ought, but Dora had better mind
her own business, and not put ideas into your
head. You mustn’t spend your time gossiping
with her, Gretel; she’s nothing but an ignorant
servant. There, I’ve finished my chocolate, and
I don’t believe my hair needs much brushing to-night.
Run off to bed; it really is terribly late
for you to be up.”</p>

<p>Gretel obeyed, but when she had bidden Ada
good night, and was taking the empty cup back
to the kitchen, she whispered softly to herself:</p>

<p>“I wonder what ‘gossip’ means? I hope I
don’t do it if it’s something not nice, but I do like
Dora very much, and I’m very glad I’m going to
know Lillie and Peter too.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>MUSIC AND CREAM-PUFFS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">GRETEL’S first sensation on waking the
next morning was that something pleasant
was going to happen. She could not
remember for the first few moments just what it
was to be, but then it all came back to her; her
conversation with Dora; her crying fit over the
piano, and Dora’s promise to bring her sister and
brother to play and sing for her. She was conscious
of a little thrill of anticipation as she sprang
out of bed and began putting on her stockings.
She had lived with Mrs. Marsh for more than a
year, but this was the first time there had ever been
a question of her having visitors of her very own.
Mrs. Marsh and her daughter had plenty of visitors,
of course, and some of them had been kind
to the little girl, but that was quite a different
thing from having people coming expressly to see
her. In the old days at the studio they were
always having visitors, and she had had almost
more friends than she could count, but since her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
father’s death all the old friends had seemed to
fade away too. They never came to Mrs.
Marsh’s, not even kind Fritz Lipheim or his
mother, with whom she had often stayed for
weeks at a time while Hermann Schiller was
away on a concert tour. Old Mrs. Lipheim had
been very good to the child, and had taught her
how to sew on her father’s buttons and mend
his socks. She was sure the Lipheims would
have liked to come to see her if they had not
feared Mrs. Marsh would object, but Mrs. Marsh
had been so very stiff and unsociable on the day
when she had come to take her away from the
studio, and had not even suggested that Gretel
should see Mrs. Lipheim again, although the little
girl had clung to her old friend, crying as if
her heart would break. Gretel was very grateful
to Mrs. Marsh, but there were times when
she could not help thinking how much pleasanter
it would have been if her brother had arranged
to have her live with the Lipheims instead of
with his cousins.</p>

<p>It was nearly eight o’clock, but Gretel’s room
was still very dark. Indeed, it was never very
light at any hour of the day, for its only window
opened on an air-shaft. It was a very small
room, and before Gretel came had always been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
occupied by the maid-of-all-work, but the apartment
was not large, and Mrs. Marsh had declared
it to be the only room she could possibly
spare, so the servant had been relegated to the
maid’s quarters at the top of the house. But
small and dark as it was, Gretel loved her room.
To begin with, it was the only place in the world
that was all her own, and then it contained all
her treasures. There was her father’s photograph
in a gilt frame, that Fritz Lipheim had
given her as a parting gift; and his old German
Bible, out of which he used to read to her and
show her pictures on Sunday afternoons. There
was also her old rag doll, Jemima. She was too
old to play with dolls, now, but it was still very
comforting to cuddle Jemima in her arms at
night, when she happened to be feeling particularly
lonely, or when Mrs. Marsh or Ada had
been unusually cross. Then there were her
father’s letters tied together with a red ribbon.
There were a good many of them, as there was
one for every day that her father had ever been
away from her. Some of the later ones were
in German, for Hermann Schiller had taught his
little daughter to read and write in his own language,
and as he and his friends usually spoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
in German when they were together, it was almost
as familiar to Gretel as English. But nobody
ever spoke in German at the Marsh’s, and
she sometimes feared she might grow to forget
her father’s language, as she was forgetting the
music he had taught her so carefully. Lastly,
there were her books, not many, and all decidedly
the worse for wear, but dearly loved,
notwithstanding. There were “Poems Every
Child Should Know”—Dickens, “Child’s History
of England”—a few old story-books, and—most
cherished of all—Grimm’s and Andersen’s
“Fairy Tales,” which she had read over
and over so many times that she almost knew
them by heart. There was not much space for
books in the little room, so they lived on the floor
under the bed, and Jemima slept in the bottom
bureau drawer with Gretel’s night-gowns and
petticoats. But notwithstanding its many drawbacks,
that little room was the pleasantest place
Gretel knew in those days, and it was there that
all her happiest hours were passed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marsh was alone at the breakfast table
when Gretel entered the dining-room. She was
reading the morning’s mail, and merely glanced
up from a letter long enough to give the child an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
indifferent nod. But Gretel had been taught by
her father that one should always wish people
a good morning, so before taking her seat at the
table, she remarked politely:</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mrs. Marsh; I hope you had
a good night.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marsh did not take the trouble to answer,
but Gretel never omitted the little formula,
“because,” as she told herself, “Father told me
always to say it, so it must be right.” She
slipped quietly into her place, and began on the
plate of oatmeal and glass of milk, which always
formed her morning meal.</p>

<p>She had not taken many spoonfuls, however,
when Mrs. Marsh finished her letter, and began
to pour her coffee. Dora, having placed the
breakfast on the table, had gone away to attend
to other household duties. Then Gretel, who
was fond of talking, felt emboldened to make
another attempt at conversation, unpromising as
such an attempt might seem.</p>

<p>“It looks a little like rain, doesn’t it? Do
you think it will rain, Mrs. Marsh?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” returned Mrs. Marsh
absently. “I wonder what is keeping Ada?
Just run and ask her how soon she will be ready,
Gretel, before I pour her coffee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>Gretel promptly departed, returning in a few
moments with the announcement that Ada was
only just awake, and would like her breakfast
in bed.</p>

<p>“Then you had better take it right in to her
before it gets cold,” Ada’s mother advised, and
leaving her own breakfast to cool, Gretel proceeded
to prepare a tempting little tray to be
carried to Miss Marsh’s bedside.</p>

<p>But tempting as the meal looked, it did not
satisfy the fastidious Ada. The toast was too
hard, and the coffee had to be sent back for more
cream. Couldn’t Gretel make her a few hot
slices of toast, and boil a fresh egg, “not more
than three minutes?” Of course Gretel could
and did, and by the time Ada was comfortably
settled with her tray, Mrs. Marsh had finished
her breakfast, and Gretel’s oatmeal was quite
cold. She was taking the plate to the kitchen,
to warm it, when Mrs. Marsh encountered her,
and asked rather sharply: “Where are you going
now?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to warm my porridge,” Gretel explained.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marsh frowned.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” she said sharply; “little girls
shouldn’t be so fussy about their food. Sit down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
and eat your breakfast at once; you’ve dawdled
over it quite long enough already.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t dawdling,” began Gretel; “I was
boiling an egg for Ada.” But Mrs. Marsh was
already half out of the room, and did not hear,
so, with a sigh of resignation, Gretel sat down
to her cold breakfast.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marsh went out to a meeting that morning,
but Ada said she had taken cold the night
before, and declared her intention of staying in
bed till luncheon time.</p>

<p>“If I got up I know I should be worse,” she
told Gretel, “and then I might have to stay at
home this evening.”</p>

<p>“You’d better be very careful,” said Gretel
in a tone of sudden apprehension. “You
wouldn’t like to have to stay at home this evening,
would you?”</p>

<p>“I should hate it,” Ada declared emphatically.
“The Scotts always give such delicious dinners,
and Ethel Scott has promised to put me next a
most delightful man.”</p>

<p>Gretel was conscious of a sensation of relief.</p>

<p>“Would you like some hot lemonade?” she
inquired eagerly. “Mrs. Lipheim once gave me
some hot lemonade when I had a cold, and it was
very nice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>Ada said she did not care for lemonade, but
added that if Gretel really wanted to make herself
useful, she might sew some buttons on her
boots.</p>

<p>So, in spite of the fact that there were no
lessons to prepare, Gretel spent a busy morning,
for after the buttons were sewed on, Ada suggested
that the child might arrange her bureau
drawers, which were “in an awful jumble,” and
that task took so long, that by the time it was
finished Mrs. Marsh had returned from her meeting
and it was nearly one o’clock.</p>

<p>It had begun to rain soon after breakfast, and
by noon had settled into a steady downpour.
Mrs. Marsh came in wet and cross, and bewailing
the fact that she would be obliged to go out
again in the afternoon.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think of going under ordinary
circumstances,” she declared, “but I really feel
it is my duty to go to Mrs. Williams’ tea. I
dare say ever so many people will stay away in
this storm, but that isn’t my way of doing things.
People always appreciate the friends who take
the trouble to come to their teas in bad weather.”</p>

<p>Gretel was a little afraid lest the storm should
prevent Lillie and Peter from coming that evening,
but Dora reassured her on that subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“They’ll come if it rains cats and dogs,” she
maintained. “They wouldn’t miss the chance
of playing and singing for the world. And you
won’t wonder when you hear Lillie,” she added,
with sisterly pride. “I declare, when she sings
‘Break the News to Mother,’ or ‘Just Before
the Battle,’ it just brings the tears into my eyes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I ever heard either of those
songs,” said Gretel. “Are they very beautiful?”
To which Dora’s only reply was a confident,
“Just wait till you hear them.”</p>

<p>Gretel was in her room reading “Snow-White
and the Seven Dwarfs” for about the fiftieth
time, when Ada’s voice once more summoned
her hand-maiden to her side. She had risen in
time for luncheon, and was now lying on the
parlor sofa reading a novel, and she greeted
Gretel with the smile that always meant she intended
asking a particular favor.</p>

<p>“Gretel dear,” she began sweetly, “would you
like to do something just awfully nice for me?”</p>

<p>Gretel looked pleased. When Ada spoke in
that tone she almost loved her.</p>

<p>“I’ll do anything you want me to,” she said,
promptly.</p>

<p>Ada glanced rather uneasily out of the window,
at the fast falling rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“Well,” she said, “you see, I’ve finished my
book, and I haven’t an earthly thing to do this
whole afternoon. If it were not for my cold I
would just run round to the library for another
book, but with this sore throat I really don’t
quite dare. So I was wondering if you would
mind going for me. It’s only four blocks, you
know, and it wouldn’t take you any time.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any waterproof, but I don’t believe
the rain will hurt my dress,” said Gretel, with a
dubious glance at the old black skirt, which certainly
did not look as though rain or anything
else could do it much injury.</p>

<p>Ada smiled sweetly.</p>

<p>“You are a dear obliging little girl,” she said.
“You can wear my waterproof, and if you bring
me back a nice interesting book I’ll—I’ll give
you a present.”</p>

<p>“How perfectly lovely!” cried Gretel, her
eyes sparkling. “I’ll be right back.” And she
darted away to look for her rubbers and umbrella.</p>

<p>When she returned some three minutes later,
she found Ada hastily scribbling the titles of
some books on a piece of paper.</p>

<p>“Just ask for one of these,” she directed, handing
the paper to Gretel. “Any one they happen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
to have in will do. Now run along like a good
child, and hurry back as fast as you can.”</p>

<p>Gretel gave a cheerful nod, slipped the paper
in her pocket, and departed, quite forgetting the
fact that Miss Marsh had not repeated her offer
of lending her a raincoat. In less than twenty
minutes she was back again, dripping but triumphant.</p>

<p>“The very first book I asked for was in,”
she announced. “Wasn’t it lucky? I’m afraid
the cover is rather wet, it’s raining so very hard,
but I kept it as dry as I could.”</p>

<p>Ada looked very much pleased.</p>

<p>“You really ought to have taken my raincoat,”
she remarked, regretfully; “you look like
a drowned rat. Go and dry yourself by the
kitchen fire, and you needn’t mention to Mamma
that you have been out.”</p>

<p>Ada had already opened her novel, but Gretel
still lingered.</p>

<p>“Is it a nice interesting book?” she inquired
rather timidly.</p>

<p>Ada laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“You sharp little thing,” she said; “you are
not going to let me out of my bargain, are you?
I’ve got your present right here; guess what it
is?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“I can’t guess,” said Gretel, her eyes beginning
to sparkle once more. “I haven’t had a present
since Father died, except the dress you and Mrs.
Marsh gave me for Christmas. Is it something
to wear?”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t,” laughed Ada; “it’s something
to spend.” And she held out to the astonished
Gretel a bright ten-cent piece.</p>

<p>If Gretel was disappointed she managed to
conceal the fact quite satisfactorily, and having
thanked Miss Marsh for her unusual generosity,
she sped away to the kitchen, where she burst in
upon Dora, who was peeling potatoes for dinner.</p>

<p>“Dora,” began the little girl eagerly, “I’ve
got something very important to consult you
about.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’d better get that wet skirt off before
you do anything else,” objected Dora.
“How that fat, lazy thing could send you out in
this storm without a waterproof beats me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she was very kind,” protested Gretel.
“She thanked me so nicely, and she gave me ten
cents for a present. That’s what I want to consult
you about. You see whenever Father had
company he always gave them something to eat.
Sometimes he couldn’t afford to have much, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
he said if it was only a cup of coffee it was better
than nothing, for it showed you wanted to be
hospitable. I can’t buy much with only ten
cents, but I should like to have some little thing
to offer Lillie and Peter this evening, and I
thought perhaps you could tell me something
they would like that wouldn’t cost more than
that.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, that’s real kind of you, I’m sure,”
declared Dora. “Not that the kids would expect
anything. They’re both crazy for ice-cream,
but you couldn’t get enough for two for ten
cents. I’ll tell you what you might get, though.
Lillie just adores cream-puffs and she doesn’t get
them often, they’re so expensive; five cents
apiece. You could just get one for each of them
for ten cents.”</p>

<p>Gretel looked much relieved.</p>

<p>“That will be just the thing,” she said; “I
hope Peter likes cream-puffs too.”</p>

<p>Dora said she was sure he did, and with a
promise to “hurry right back,” Gretel once more
fared forth into the storm; this time to call at
the baker’s shop on the next corner.</p>

<p>Gretel’s heart was beating high with anticipation
as she assisted Ada with her toilet that evening.
Her only cause for anxiety had been removed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
now that two fat cream-puffs had been deposited
in Dora’s charge, and she was all eagerness
to welcome the expected guests. Mrs.
Marsh and her daughter did not leave for their
dinner party until nearly eight, but Gretel had
had an early tea in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“I hope you got thoroughly dry after your
wetting this afternoon,” Ada remarked, with belated
anxiety, as she drew on her gloves.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Gretel, cheerfully; “Dora
made me sit by the kitchen fire till my skirt was
quite dry. There was a hole in one of my rubbers,
and a good deal of water got inside, but it
didn’t do me any harm.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” murmured Ada, absently. “I
think I have an extra pair I can lend you the
next time you go out in the rain. I suppose you
will amuse yourself drumming on the piano this
evening as usual.”</p>

<p>Gretel smiled, but did not answer, and just
then Dora announced that the cab Mrs. Marsh
had ordered was at the door, and the two ladies
hurried away to their dinner party.</p>

<p>“Remember, Gretel, you are not to sit up late
again to-night,” were Mrs. Marsh’s parting
words. “Little girls must go early to bed if
they want to grow up well and strong.” She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
glanced rather anxiously at Gretel’s pale thin
little face as she spoke. It had begun to dawn
upon her of late that the child was not looking
particularly strong.</p>

<p>Gretel promised that she would not sit up late,
adding innocently that she did not suppose Ada
would need any chocolate, as she was going to a
dinner party, at which remark Mrs. Marsh
frowned and looked annoyed.</p>

<p>As soon as the closing of the elevator door
assured Gretel that Mrs. Marsh and her daughter
were really gone, she flew off to the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Have they come?” she demanded breathlessly.
“Ada took so long dressing I was dreadfully
afraid they might get here before she was
ready.”</p>

<p>“No, they haven’t come yet,” said Dora, glancing
up from the <i>Evening World</i> which she had
borrowed from the elevator-boy, “but they’ll be
here soon now. I told them not to come before
eight.”</p>

<p>“You are sure they got your postal, aren’t
you?” inquired Gretel, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, they got that all right,” responded Dora,
with so much conviction that Gretel felt very
much relieved.</p>

<p>“I think,” she said, gravely, “that the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
way will be to have the music first and the refreshments
afterwards. That’s the way Father
always did. He said people never liked to play
or sing right after eating.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t bother about that,” said
Dora. “Lillie’d sing just as good on a full
stomach as on an empty one. She’s an awful
eater, anyway, and so’s Peter. I never saw two
kids that can stuff the way those two can. But,
look here, hadn’t you better keep one of those
cream-puffs for yourself? You didn’t have very
much in the way of supper.”</p>

<p>Gretel shook her head resolutely.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t eat one for the world,” she protested.
“Mrs. Marsh says it isn’t good for
people to eat too much, and Father and I were
often rather hungry the day after he had had
company to supper. We never minded, though,
and Father said he would so much rather be
hungry than not be hospitable. Oh, there’s the
bell! It must be Lillie and Peter.”</p>

<p>It was Lillie and Peter. Dora went to open
the door, and when she returned she was accompanied
by two guests; a girl of thirteen, in a
green plaid dress, and wearing two long pigtails
hanging down her back, and a boy of eleven,
with very red hair, and so many freckles, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Gretel regarded him with a kind of fascinated
horror. She was sure he was the very plainest
boy she had ever seen in her life.</p>

<p>“Here they are,” announced Dora, proudly,
as she ushered in the visitors; “this is my sister
Miss Lillie Grubb, and this is my brother Peter
Grubb. Miss Gretel Schiller.”</p>

<p>Both the visitors looked rather embarrassed,
and Peter’s freckled face grew very red indeed,
but Gretel, with native politeness, came forward
and held out her hand.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you could both come,” she said
in her sweet, cordial little voice; “it was very
good of you. You can’t think how anxious I
am to hear you play and sing. I haven’t heard
any music in such a long time.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure we were very pleased to accept your
invitation,” returned Lillie, in her most grown-up
manner, and she shook Gretel’s hand very
much as though it had been a pump-handle.
Peter said nothing, but stuck both hands into
his pockets, and grew redder than ever.</p>

<p>“Dora says you sing beautifully,” Gretel went
on, “and your brother plays. My father was
a great pianist; perhaps you have heard of him;
his name was Hermann Schiller.”</p>

<p>“N—no, I don’t think so,” Lillie admitted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
reluctantly. “I’ve heard of Dan W. Quinn and
George J. Gaskin, but they were both singers.
Did your father play for the phonograph company?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Father didn’t care much for phonographs;
he played in concerts and wrote beautiful
music. Perhaps your brother plays some of
his things.”</p>

<p>Lillie looked very much surprised.</p>

<p>“I thought everybody loved phonographs,”
she said; “we have one that Father bought
second-hand, and we keep it going all the time
we’re in the house. We’ve got some dandy
records. Peter makes up most of his own pieces;
you see, he’s never had a lesson in his life.
Where’s your piano?”</p>

<p>“In the parlor,” said Gretel. “Take off your
things, and we’ll go right in. I’m so anxious
to have the music begin.”</p>

<p>She turned to Peter with a friendly smile, but
that young man was absorbed in removing his
rubbers, and did not respond. Lillie, however,
appeared to be quite equal to the occasion, for
she remarked politely:</p>

<p>“You must play for us, too; Dora says you
play the piano something grand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I don’t,” protested Gretel, blushing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
“I used to play much better than I do now; I’m
afraid I’ve forgotten a great deal. I shall be
glad to play for you, though, if you would really
like to have me.” And then, as the visitors had
finished removing their out-door garments, she
led the way to the parlor.</p>

<p>The first object to attract Peter’s attention was
the candy box on the parlor table, and he opened
his lips for the first time, and remarked in a
rather high-pitched voice:</p>

<p>“Gee! you’ve got something good in that box,
I bet.”</p>

<p>Gretel was very much embarrassed.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we can’t have any of it,” she explained.
“I’m very sorry, but you see, it doesn’t
belong to me. A gentleman sent it to Miss
Marsh, and I don’t believe she would like to
have us touch it. We’re going to have some—some
refreshments by and by.”</p>

<p>Peter—who had already lifted the lid from
the candy box—looked rather crestfallen, but
Lillie again came to the front.</p>

<p>“Never mind him,” she remarked, airily;
“Peter’s an awful greedy boy.”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” retorted her brother. “I ain’t
one bit greedier than you are.”</p>

<p>Lillie flushed indignantly, but before she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
reply, Dora—who had lingered behind to hang
the children’s wet raincoats up to dry—appeared
upon the scene, and hastened to interpose.</p>

<p>“Now stop fighting this minute, the two of
you,” she commanded. “You didn’t come here
to fight. Sit right down at that piano, Lillie,
and show Miss Gretel how you can sing.”</p>

<p>Thus admonished, Lillie took her place on the
piano stool, and the other three seated themselves
in a solemn row on the sofa.</p>

<p>“What shall I begin with?” inquired Lillie.
“I know such a lot of songs; I never have any
idea what to sing first.”</p>

<p>“Sing ‘Poppa, Tell Me Where is Momma,’”
suggested Dora. “That’s a beautiful song, and
so touching; I know Miss Gretel will love it.”</p>

<p>Peter muttered something about “that stuff
being no good,” but nobody paid any attention
to him, and after striking a few preliminary
chords Lillie began to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“‘Poppa, tell me where is Momma?’</div>
<div class="indent">Said a little child one day;</div>
<div class="verse">‘Tell me why I cannot see her—</div>
<div class="indent">Tell me why she went away.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Gretel gave one little horrified gasp, and
clasped her hands tightly. For the first moment
she was so disappointed that she could scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
keep back her rising tears. Was this the music
to which she had been looking forward so eagerly
all day? By a great effort she controlled the
sudden desire to put her fingers in her ears, to
shut out those dreadful, unharmonious sounds,
but politeness soon overcame other feelings, and
by the time Lillie had finished her song and
turned from the piano for the expected applause,
she was able to give a faint smile, and murmur
something about “it’s being very pretty.”</p>

<p>“Now sing ‘Hello, Central. Give Me
Heaven!’” commanded Dora, who was looking
both proud and triumphant, and without a second’s
hesitation, Lillie plunged into another sentimental
ballad, if possible even more mournful
than “Poppa, Tell Me Where is Momma!”</p>

<p>The hour that followed was one of the most
uncomfortable Gretel had ever spent. It seemed
as if Lillie’s stock of songs was endless. The
moment one came to an end her proud sister
requested another, and the more she sang the
more she appeared to be enjoying herself. Peter
looked very much bored, but dared not express
his feelings in Dora’s presence, and was forced
to content himself with chewing a large piece
of gum, which he had produced from his pocket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
and occasionally giving vent to his emotions by
kicking the legs of the sofa viciously. Gretel
was just beginning to wonder whether Lillie intended
to go on for the rest of the evening, when
a diversion was caused by a ring at the door-bell,
which caused a momentary excitement.</p>

<p>“I’ll go and see who it is,” said Dora. “Just
keep still till I come back, Lillie. If it’s callers
they mustn’t hear anything. They might tell
Mrs. Marsh.”</p>

<p>Dora hurried away, and profound silence
reigned in the parlor during her absence. Peter
stuck his tongue out at Lillie, by way of giving
vent to his long pent-up rage, but she was so much
absorbed in trying to recall the third verse of
“Just as the Sun Went Down,” to notice him. In
a few moments Dora returned.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” she announced cheerfully; “it
was only a girl I know, who lives down on the
second floor. She wants me to go to her room
for a minute to fit a waist on her. I won’t be
long, and mind you behave yourselves while I’m
gone.”</p>

<p>“Of course we’ll behave,” protested Lillie, indignantly;
“what do you think we are, anyway?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“Oh, you’re all right, I guess, but I’m not so
sure about Peter. You’ll be a good boy, won’t
you, Peter?”</p>

<p>“Yep,” promised Peter, and Dora departed,
after repeating the assurance that she would not
be long.</p>

<p>No sooner had the outer door of the apartment
closed behind Dora than her younger brother was
on his feet. A look of daring and defiance had
suddenly replaced the rather vacant expression
of his countenance. In two rapid strides he
reached the piano, and seized his sister firmly, but
not gently, by one of her long braids.</p>

<p>“Come off of there,” he commanded in a tone
of authority. “Quit your squalling, and give
somebody else a chance to show off.”</p>

<p>“Leave me alone, Peter,” urged Lillie, coaxingly;
“I haven’t finished yet. I’ve just remembered
the third verse.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t,” returned Peter, with decision.
“You’ve sung seventeen songs already; now it’s
my turn.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do let Peter play for us,” put in Gretel,
eagerly. “Dora says he plays so well, and I do
love the piano so much.”</p>

<p>Lillie looked as if she would have liked to refuse,
but she had been warned by her mother to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
“remember her manners,” and, moreover the grip
on her braid assured her that Peter meant business,
so, with a sigh of resignation, she vacated
her seat on the piano stool, remarking as she did
so:</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, of course, if you want to hear
him, but he really can’t play worth a cent.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I, though?” shouted Peter defiantly.
“Who says I can’t? Ain’t Father trying to get
me into vaudeville to do my stunts? Just listen,
and I’ll show you the noise it makes when a
drunken man falls down-stairs.”</p>

<p>Gretel’s eyes were round with astonishment,
but Lillie only shrugged her shoulders indifferently,
and walking over to the other side of the
room, proceeded to make herself acquainted with
the contents of Mrs. Marsh’s workbasket. Peter
seated himself on the piano stool, struck a few
thundering chords and began what was considered
by his family and friends his “very best
stunt.”</p>

<p>What followed was so awful that Gretel could
never think of it afterwards without a shudder.
She bore it in silence for fully five minutes, while
Peter endeavored to represent the different sounds
supposed to be made by the unfortunate drunken
man in his efforts to escape from a saloon, until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
the final catastrophe, when, having reached the top
of a flight of stairs, he, in Peter’s own words,
“took a header,” and plunged headlong from top
to bottom. This Peter represented by a rapidly
running scale from one end of the piano to the
other, ending with a terrific crash, which brought
Gretel to her feet with a cry of horror.</p>

<p>“Stop, oh, please, please stop,” she implored,
seizing Peter’s uplifted arm just as it was about
to descend upon the keys with another deafening
crash; “it’s—it’s so dreadful!”</p>

<p>Peter’s arm dropped to his side, and he regarded
his little hostess in amazement.</p>

<p>“You—you don’t like it?” he stammered incredulously.</p>

<p>“No, oh, no,” gasped Gretel. “Please don’t
do it again; I’m afraid you’ll break the piano.”</p>

<p>Peter was offended. Never before had his
“very best stunt” been received in such a manner.</p>

<p>“I won’t play any more,” he said, sulkily.
“I don’t know what you want, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I told her she wouldn’t like it,” scoffed Lillie.
“She likes real music, the same as I do. You’d better
let me finish ‘Just as the Sun Went Down.’”</p>

<p>But Peter had no intention of yielding the
point so easily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“You’ve sung enough,” he maintained doggedly.
“It’s her turn to play now; let’s see what
she can do.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you wouldn’t care about my
music,” said Gretel, blushing. “Don’t you think
perhaps it would be a good idea to have the refreshments
now?”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Peter, his face brightening.</p>

<p>Lillie said nothing, but cast more than one regretful
glance in the direction of the piano as
Gretel led the way to the dining-room.</p>

<p>“Now, will you please sit here while I get
things ready?” said Gretel, drawing up two
chairs to the dining table. She was feeling decidedly
relieved at having gotten her visitors
safely away from the piano.</p>

<p>“What have you got?” demanded Peter, the
last vestige of whose shyness had melted away
the moment his sister Dora left the room.</p>

<p>“Something very nice,” said Gretel, smiling;
“at least I hope you’ll think them nice. Dora
said Lillie was very fond of them.”</p>

<p>Both visitors looked interested. Lillie seated
herself at the table, and folded her hands primly
in her lap. But Peter was not so easily satisfied.</p>

<p>“Let’s go and see what it is,” he proposed to
his sister, as Gretel left the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“Of course not,” said Lillie, indignantly.
“Ain’t we company? Company never goes into
the kitchen in places like this.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!” retorted Peter. “She ain’t nothing
but a kid, like us. I’m going, anyway.”</p>

<p>And, deaf to his sister’s expostulations, he followed
Gretel into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Having secured the precious cream-puffs from
the ice chest, and placed them on a plate covered
with a napkin, Gretel was in the act of procuring
another plate and a couple of forks, when, startled
by a slight sound behind her, she turned to
find Peter once more at her elbow.</p>

<p>“I say!” exclaimed that youth in a tone of
rapture, “it’s cream-puffs, the best ever; but
ain’t there more than two?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Gretel, regretfully, “I—I couldn’t
manage to get but two, but I thought it would
be all right. They’re quite large, and you can
each have one. I don’t care about any myself.”</p>

<p>Peter regarded the two fat cream-puffs with
longing eyes.</p>

<p>“That pig, Lill, would grab ’em both if she
got her hands on ’em,” he remarked reflectively.
“I’ll tell you what we’ll do; we’ll eat ’em up here,
and she won’t know. She’s got such grand manners
she won’t come into the kitchen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“Oh, no, that wouldn’t be at all nice,” protested
Gretel, half laughing in spite of her horror
at Peter’s suggestion. “You can each have one;
I truly don’t want any myself.”</p>

<p>But the demon of mischief had entered into
Peter Grubb. Before Gretel had the least idea
of his intention, he had sprung forward, snatched
both cream-puffs from the plate, and was brandishing
one in each hand.</p>

<p>“Catch me if you can,” he shouted, and the
next moment he had darted out of the kitchen,
and was running at full speed down the long
entry.</p>

<p>Attracted by the sound of triumph in her
brother’s voice, Lillie forgot manners and everything
else, sprang from her seat, and rushed out
into the hall.</p>

<p>“What’s he up to?” she demanded breathlessly.</p>

<p>“He’s taken the cream-puffs and run off with
them,” explained Gretel, almost in tears at such
an exhibition of rudeness as she had never before
known. She was still carrying the empty plate, in
the vain hope of reclaiming “the refreshments.”</p>

<p>“Cream-puffs!” shrieked Lillie; “my fa-vo-rites!”
And she rushed off in pursuit of Peter,
who had taken refuge in Mrs. Marsh’s bedroom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
and was already cramming a cream-puff into his
mouth, with lightning speed.</p>

<p>Then followed a scene the like of which had
never before taken place in Mrs. Marsh’s well-ordered
apartment. In the scrimmage rugs were
rolled up, chairs overturned, and portières and
curtains roughly torn aside. Lillie’s temper was
up, and she fought for her rights like a true little
street Arab she was. She was two years older
than her brother, and considerably stronger, but
Peter was as agile as a monkey, and moreover,
he had the advantage of having been the first to
secure the prey. In the first moment of the fight
Gretel had made a futile effort to separate the
combatants, but it was quite useless and she could
do nothing but stand idly by, wringing her hands
in helpless despair.</p>

<p>“You’ll hurt each other; oh, you will, I’m
sure!” she wailed, as Lillie, having at last captured
her brother, fell upon him, and began pommeling
him furiously, while children and cream-puffs
rolled over and over on the floor in a confused
heap.</p>

</figure>

<p>There was so much noise that nobody heard
the opening of the outer door, and it was only
when Dora, with a howl of rage, swept down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>upon the combatants, that her younger sister and
brother were even aware of her presence.</p>

<p>“You two little limbs of Satan!” cried the
irate elder sister; “is this the way you behave
when I leave you alone for ten minutes? Get
up off that floor this instant. Mercy sakes alive,
what a mess! How in the world am I ever to
get it cleaned up before Mrs. Marsh comes
home?”</p>

<p>How indeed? For even as Dora spoke a key
was being turned in the front door, and in another
moment it had opened and closed again.
Gretel, being nearest the door, was the first to
note the danger, and with a desperate effort to
save the situation, she sprang forward to meet
Mrs. Marsh and her daughter.</p>

<p>“We—we didn’t expect you home so early,”
she faltered. “I hope you won’t mind very
much, but—”</p>

<p>“I had a bad headache and excused myself as
soon as we left the dinner-table,” interrupted Mrs.
Marsh. “How is it that you are not in bed? I
thought I told you to go to bed early.”</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry,” began Gretel, but got no
further, for at that moment Mrs. Marsh caught
sight of something else—something so astounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
as to drive every other thought from her
mind.</p>

<p>“What does this mean? Who are these
people?” she demanded in a voice of such awful
sternness that even Peter quailed. He and Lillie
had scrambled to their feet, their faces and garments
thickly plastered with the contents of the
luckless cream-puffs.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Marsh, please don’t be angry,”
pleaded the trembling Gretel. “They’re only
Lillie and Peter, Dora’s sister and brother, and
they came to play and sing for me. I bought
some cream-puffs for refreshments, and—”</p>

<p>“That’s enough. I have heard all that is necessary.
Dora, send those children home at once,
and then come back here and clear up this disgusting
mess. You know my rules about visitors,
but I will say no more to you until the
morning. Go to your room at once, Gretel, and
don’t let me hear another word from you to-night.”</p>

<p>“But, Mrs. Marsh, please don’t blame Dora;
it was all my fault. She only asked them to
come for my sake, because I said I was so fond
of music.” Gretel clasped her hands imploringly,
and the tears were streaming down her cheeks,
but Mrs. Marsh was obdurate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“Not another word,” she commanded, waving
her hand majestically in the direction of Gretel’s
room. “My head is aching frightfully, and I
must go to bed at once, but in the morning I
shall have more to say on this subject. As for
Dora, she knows my rules, and what she has to
expect. I believe her month will be up the end
of this week.”</p>

<small>A TICKET TO FAIRY-LAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“I&#8202; WANT to have a little talk with you,
Gretel.”</p>

<p>Gretel looked up with a start from the
pile of stockings she was darning. Mrs. Marsh,
solemn and majestic as usual, was blocking the
doorway of her little room, and there was an
ominous sound in her voice which caused Gretel’s
heart to beat uncomfortably fast.</p>

<p>“Won’t you come in?” she said, timidly, rising
to offer her visitor the only chair the room
contained, but Mrs. Marsh waved her back impatiently.</p>

<p>“Go on with your work,” she commanded.
“I don’t care to sit down; I can say all I have
to say in a few words. I am very sorry to be
obliged to find fault with you, Gretel, but I feel
that I must speak to you about your behavior of
the past two weeks. Ada has spoken of it several
times, but I have postponed mentioning it to
you, hoping things might improve. You have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
not been at all like yourself since the night those
disgusting children were here.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marsh paused, as if expecting Gretel to
speak. The little girl had grown very red, and
her lip was trembling, but she said nothing, and
after waiting a moment Mrs. Marsh went on.</p>

<p>“It is rather difficult to fix upon any one particular
thing you have done, but your whole manner
has been different. You have not looked
happy; indeed, you have appeared quite sullen at
times. Now sullenness is a very disagreeable
trait in a child. When your brother placed you
in my care, he expected me to take a mother’s
place to you, and so, painful though it may be, I
feel that it is my duty to reprove you for your
faults.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marsh paused again, and this time Gretel
raised her big honest brown eyes to her face; they
were full of tears.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” she said simply; “I didn’t mean
to be sullen, but you see, I haven’t been very
happy since Dora went away.”</p>

<p>“Not been happy?” repeated Mrs. Marsh, her
voice rising in astonishment; “and why have you
not been happy, pray?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly,” said Gretel, “but Dora
was very kind to me, and I liked her. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
wouldn’t have let Lillie and Peter come if I hadn’t
said I loved music, and so it was partly my fault
that she had to go away.”</p>

<p>“If that is all that is troubling you you may
dismiss the matter from your mind at once,” said
Mrs. Marsh, decidedly. “The girl was very
careless and incompetent, and I should probably
have dismissed her at any rate. As for the mischief
caused by those dreadful children, that certainly
was partly your fault. You had no business
to bring food into the house without my
permission, but I forgave you for that when you
assured me you were sorry. I never bear malice,
and even though my carpet is practically ruined,
I did not intend to refer to the matter again. It
is your sullen, disagreeable manner that has
pained me so deeply.”</p>

<p>Two big tears splashed down Gretel’s cheeks,
and dropped on the stocking she was darning.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry,” she murmured tremulously;
“I don’t want to pain anybody.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marsh’s face softened a little.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you do,” she admitted.
“You are generally a very well-behaved child, I
will say that for you, Gretel. You have been
much less trouble than I expected you to be when
I consented to take charge of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“Have I really?” inquired Gretel, her face
brightening; “but what made you take me when
you thought I was going to be so much trouble?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marsh frowned.</p>

<p>“You talk too much, Gretel,” she said reprovingly;
“little girls should not ask so many questions.
I have always tried to do what I have
felt to be my duty. Now I hope I have said
all that is necessary on this subject. If I see an
improvement in your manner I shall know that
my little talk has not been in vain. Ada and I
like to see happy faces about us, and I am sure
that if any child in this world should be happy
you should. I wonder how many little girls of
your age are having a lovely long holiday right
in the middle of the school year? By the way,
I had a letter from my sister this morning, in
which she tells me that her friend has decided to
remain in California longer than she at first expected.
They will not be back before the middle
of April.”</p>

<p>Gretel did not look as much pleased at this
news as Mrs. Marsh evidently expected.</p>

<p>“I’m rather sorry,” she said. “I like Miss
Talcott, and she was so very kind about letting
me play on her piano. I don’t mind lessons
much; I used to love them when Father taught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
me. But I will try not to be sullen, Mrs. Marsh;
I really didn’t know I was.”</p>

<p>“That is right,” said Mrs. Marsh, in a tone
of relief. “Now we have discussed this matter
quite enough, and I must hurry. Are you going
out this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Ada wants me to take her new dress back
to the dressmaker’s. Something has to be done
to the skirt, and she’s going to stop and try it on
on her way home, but she doesn’t want to carry
the box herself, it’s so heavy.”</p>

<p>“Very well; the walk will do you good, but
don’t stay out too long. It isn’t at all the proper
thing for little girls to be in the streets after it
begins to grow dark.”</p>

<p>Gretel promised that she would be in the house
before dark, and Mrs. Marsh departed, feeling
that she had done all that was necessary in the
way of “administering a gentle reproof.”</p>

<p>When she was alone Gretel sat quite still for
several minutes; her hands lying idly in her lap.
She was thinking hard. It was quite true that
she had not been happy, but she had not supposed
Mrs. Marsh or her daughter had noticed that
fact. Dora was the first one of all the long list
of maids who had come and gone during her
residence with Mrs. Marsh who had ever taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
any particular interest in her. Dora was rough,
and not very neat, but Gretel had liked her, and
there did not seem to be many people to like, now
that her father was dead, and all the old friends
had gone out of her life. The colored woman
who now filled Dora’s place was anything but
prepossessing, and Ada had been suffering from
a cold, which always made her more cross and
exacting than usual. She had not meant to be
sullen. She had tried very hard to be grateful,
as Mrs. Marsh had so often told her she ought
to be. She really had no idea that Mrs. Marsh
had cared whether she was happy or not.</p>

<p>“I wonder if she truly does care,” she reflected.
“She doesn’t always say things that are quite
true. It wasn’t true when she told Mr. Pendleton
she would rather hear a symphony concert than
go to the theater. She doesn’t really love music
a bit, and I don’t believe she loves me, either,
though she told that lady who was here the other
day, that I was as dear to her as her own child.
I don’t suppose anybody will ever love me very
much now I haven’t got Father any more.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, without quite knowing why she was
doing it, Gretel found herself crying—crying
so hard that the stockings rolled off her lap onto
the floor, and she buried her face in her hands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
and shook from head to foot with great choking
sobs.</p>

<p>But the cry did her good, and being a plucky
little soul, she soon cheered up again, dried her
eyes, picked up the stockings, and went on with
her darning.</p>

<p>When the stockings were finished, and put
away in Ada’s drawer, Gretel went to the window
to look out. The sun was shining, but there was
a fierce wind blowing, which rattled the window
frames, and sent great clouds of dust into the
faces of the passers-by. It did not look like a
very pleasant afternoon for a walk. Gretel
glanced over across the street at fairy-land,
which was closed and deserted that afternoon,
but there was nothing surprising about that fact,
for it was only Friday, and fairy-land was seldom
open on any afternoon but Saturday. But as
Gretel glanced at the familiar building, her eye
was caught by an announcement, which was
posted up in large letters “Saturday Matinee,
2 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, Lohengrin.”</p>

<p>Gretel caught her breath in a little gasp, and
just then she saw two young girls come out of
the opera house, and one of them paused on the
steps to put an envelope into her purse.</p>

<p>“She’s been buying a ticket,” said the child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
to herself. “I wonder if it’s for ‘Lohengrin.’
Oh, how very happy she must be!”</p>

<p>But there was nothing to be gained by standing
there dreaming of impossibilities, and she
must hurry if she intended to do Ada’s errand,
and be at home again before dark. So she turned
resolutely away from the window, and ten minutes
later was toiling up Broadway in the teeth
of the fierce March wind, carrying the big box,
containing Miss Marsh’s new dress.</p>

<p>It was nearly a mile to the dressmaker’s, and
the box was heavy for small weak arms to carry,
but no one had suggested her taking a car, and
as her supply of ready money consisted of but
three pennies, riding was out of the question.
It was very cold, although it was the middle of
March, and by the time Gretel reached her destination
her teeth were chattering, and she was
shivering from head to foot.</p>

<p>Relieved of her burden, however, the walk
home was more comfortable, and for the first few
blocks she almost ran, to get her blood in circulation.
Then she suddenly realized that she was
very tired, and the poor little feet began to lag
once more.</p>

<p>“If it were only nice and warm I could sit
down in Bryant Park, and watch the children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
play,” she told herself, with a sigh. “Oh, I
shall be glad when summer comes, only then
fairy-land will be all shut up, and I can’t watch
the people going in any more.”</p>

<p>Just then a fiercer gust than usual tore off her
hat, and by the time she had caught it again, after
an exciting chase of more than a block, she began
to feel quite warm. Still, it was a relief when
the sight of the big opera house assured her that
she had almost reached home. There was only
one more wide crossing, and then she would be
safely indoors, away from the wind and dust.</p>

<p>She paused on the curb, waiting for a momentary
lull in the long stream of cars and automobiles,
and just at that moment something white
came fluttering along the sidewalk, and rested
at her feet.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a letter,” said Gretel to herself,
stooping to pick up the envelope; “somebody
must have dropped it. No, it isn’t a letter
either; it’s a ticket. Oh!” Gretel gave one great
gasp, and in another second she was darting
across the street, clutching a white envelope
tightly in her hand.</p>

<p>Her heart was beating so fast when she entered
the apartment-house that she could scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
breathe. It was not until she had reached her
own little room, unmolested and unquestioned,
that she dared draw a long free breath. Then
she sank down on the edge of the bed, and for
the first time since that one hurried glance in the
street, ventured to examine the contents of the
soiled white envelope.</p>

<p>There was not much in the envelope; only one
small, thin ticket, but if it had been a hundred-dollar
bill Gretel could not have gazed upon it
with greater awe. For it was nothing less than
an admission to fairy-land.</p>

<p>“It’s for Saturday afternoon,” she said in a
rapturous whisper; “it’s for ‘Lohengrin!’ Oh,
how wonderful, how wonderful!”</p>

<p>In those first moments she had no other thought
than that this wonderful thing had, by some unknown,
wholly inexplicable chance, been sent to
her. How it happened to be lying there on the
sidewalk did not even occur to her. She kept
repeating over to herself: “It’s mine; it’s really
mine; nobody can take it away from me!”</p>

<p>She sat for some time, gazing at her treasure,
with loving eyes. Then she rose, and went to
the bureau.</p>

<p>“I must put it away very carefully,” she said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
to herself. “No one must know anything about
it. If Mrs. Marsh knew she might not let me
keep it; she might make me—”</p>

<p>Gretel’s hold on the precious ticket tightened
imperceptibly, and she grew suddenly very pale.</p>

<p>“She might make me take it back to the opera
house,” she finished, with a gasp.</p>

<p>Then, all at once came another thought—a
thought so dreadful that she actually began to
tremble.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I ought to take it back,” she whispered.
“It may belong to some one; some one
may have dropped it. Oh, but I can’t—I can’t!
Nobody in the whole world can possibly want it
as much as I do.”</p>

<p>Just then she heard Mrs. Marsh’s voice in the
hall, and hastily opening her bureau drawer, she
thrust the envelope and its contents deep down
among her handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>Both Mrs. Marsh and her daughter regarded
Gretel curiously when she appeared at the dinner-table
that evening. The child’s cheeks were
flushed, and there was such a feverish brightness
in her eyes that Mrs. Marsh began to fear she
was going to be ill. But when she questioned
Gretel on the subject, the little girl assured her
eagerly that she was quite well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“You aren’t eating much dinner, at any rate,”
remarked Ada, with a wondering glance at
Gretel’s almost untouched plate. “You ought
to have a good appetite after your walk in the
wind. What an awful afternoon it was. I was
almost blown off my feet coming round the corner
by the opera house. Madame has promised
to have my dress ready for me to wear to the
wedding to-morrow, Mamma. Are you very
tired, Gretel?”</p>

<p>“I’m not tired at all,” replied Gretel, in a
rather dreamy, faraway voice.</p>

<p>“Little girls who cannot eat their dinners
properly should not be allowed any dessert,” said
Mrs. Marsh, severely. But Gretel only smiled,
and when the dessert appeared she ate so little
of it that Mrs. Marsh felt more uneasy than before.</p>

<p>“You had better go to bed early, Gretel,” she
advised, “and I will give you a dose of medicine,
for I am sure your stomach must be upset.” And
when Gretel had retired obediently directly after
dinner, Mrs. Marsh spoke with more severity
than usual to her daughter, on the folly of sending
the child on such a long walk in the wind.</p>

<p>Gretel swallowed her medicine without a word
of protest, and then, having locked her door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
against intruders, she once more drew her treasure
from its hiding-place.</p>

<p>“It is mine; it is; it is!” she told herself
almost fiercely. “I found it. I don’t have to
take it back. Perhaps the person who dropped
it doesn’t care any more about ‘Lohengrin’ than
Mrs. Marsh and Ada do. Anyway, nobody
knows where it is now; nobody but me, and I
want it—oh, I want it more than I ever wanted
anything in my life before.”</p>

<p>And then Gretel undressed very quickly, and
crept into bed, with the ticket to fairy-land safely
deposited under her pillow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>THE COMING OF THE PRINCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was half-past one on Saturday afternoon.
Mrs. Marsh and her daughter had gone out
of town to attend the wedding of a friend,
and Gretel knew they could not return much before
six o’clock. She had finished her solitary
luncheon, for which she had little more appetite
than for her dinner the previous evening, and was
standing before the bureau in her little room,
putting on her hat and jacket. Her heart was
thumping in great excited bounds, and her eyes
shone in a way which would have convinced
Mrs. Marsh more firmly than ever, had she seen
them, that the child was feverish.</p>

<p>Ever since she awoke that morning Gretel had
been fighting with her conscience. That ever
persistent “small voice” had been making itself
heard very clearly, but with an almost desperate
determination, the little girl had resolutely closed
her “inward ear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“I must go; I must; I must,” she kept repeating
over and over to herself. “If it wasn’t
‘Lohengrin,’ I would take it back, but Father
loved ‘Lohengrin’ best of all. Oh, it can’t be
so very wrong; I am sure it can’t.”</p>

<p>And now the magic hour had actually come.
All the morning she had watched the clock, and
it had seemed to her that time had never dragged
so before. She was sure it ought to have been
at least twelve, when the hands of that tiresome
clock would persist in pointing to only half-past
ten. But at last it was really time to start.</p>

<p>“I’ll go very early,” she had decided. “It
will be so beautiful to just sit there and hear the
instruments being tuned.”</p>

<p>There was no necessity of making any explanation
to the colored maid. She was a stupid,
careless person, to whom Gretel and her affairs
were of very little consequence, and would
scarcely have noticed whether the child were in
the house or out of it.</p>

<p>Gretel’s hand shook so that she could scarcely
hold the precious ticket, as she stepped out of
the apartment-house, and crossed the street to
fairy-land. Early as it was the lobby of the
opera house was already crowded, and there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
a long line of people waiting for tickets. Gretel
pushed her way through the jostling throng,
and presented her ticket.</p>

<p>“Balcony, three flights up,” said the man at
the gate, hurriedly, and turned to the next comer.
In another moment Gretel was climbing the long
flight of stairs to the balcony.</p>

<p>She was quite breathless when she reached her
destination, and the usher who took her check,
and showed her to her seat, regarded the little
girl rather curiously. But there was no time to
waste in asking questions, so he contented himself
with assuring Gretel good-naturedly that
“there was lots of time; the opera didn’t begin
till two.”</p>

<p>It was all just as she had remembered it, and
pictured it to herself again and again. The
great house; the crowds of people, and the orchestra
tuning up their instruments. With a
great sigh of unutterable relief, she sank back in
her seat—for the first time in nearly twenty-four
hours she felt safe.</p>

<p>“I’m here; I’m really in fairy-land,” she
whispered rapturously, “and I’m going to hear
‘Lohengrin.’”</p>

<p>Then the leader of the orchestra appeared, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
was greeted by a burst of applause, followed
by a sudden stillness, and in another moment
the overture had begun. For the next three
hours Gretel was living in a wonderful, beautiful
dream. It was even more beautiful than she had
anticipated, and she drank in every note of the
marvelous music as a person dying of thirst might
drink water. During the intermissions she
leaned back, with closed eyes, waiting in a kind
of silent rapture for the curtain to rise again.
As to what would happen when it was all over,
and she would have to leave fairy-land and go
back to Mrs. Marsh’s again, she never once
thought of that.</p>

<p>But everything, even in fairy-land, must come
to an end at last. It was after five, and “Lohengrin”
had sung his farewell, and sailed away
in his mysterious swan boat, while the swan
himself, miraculously transformed into the heroine’s
long-lost brother, embraced his heart-broken
sister. And then, amid a perfect storm of applause,
the curtain fell for the last time that
afternoon; “Lohengrin” was over.</p>

<p>The performance had been an unusually fine
one, and many of the audience had tears in their
eyes as the curtain fell on that final scene, but
to one little heart the last notes of the orchestra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
fell like the knell of doom. For several minutes
Gretel remained in her seat, while the applause
continued, and the singers came before the curtain
again and again to bow their thanks. All about
her people were putting on their wraps, but still
she did not move. At last some one touched her
on the arm.</p>

<p>“Please let me pass,” said a voice, and Gretel
awoke from her dream to find the eyes of a
plainly-dressed, elderly lady fixed upon her
kindly. With a sudden start, she sprang to her
feet.</p>

<p>“Is it really all over?” she inquired in the
voice of a person suddenly awaking from a long
sleep.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is really all over,” answered the lady,
smiling. “You have enjoyed it, haven’t you?
I have been watching you all the afternoon.”</p>

<p>Gretel did not answer. It would not have been
possible for her to have spoken just then, there
was such a big lump in her throat, and the tears
were so very near the surface. She turned away
quickly, and the lady, thinking she was shy, paid
no further attention to her.</p>

<p>How bitterly cold it was. Gretel shook from
head to foot as she stepped from the steam-heated
building out into the windy street. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
what was more surprising to Gretel than the sudden
change of atmosphere, was the fact that it
was still broad daylight, and that the sun was
shining almost as brightly as it had done when
she entered fairy-land. She had so completely
lost count of time that it had not occurred to her
that the world would look just the same when
she came back to it again. For the first moment
she was almost dazed, and then, with a mighty
effort, she pulled herself together, and hurried
across the street. To be alone in her own room,
that was her one desire just then. She must cry,
and nobody must see her. After she had cried
for a long time perhaps that dreadful choking
feeling in her throat would go away, and she
would be able to talk to people again.</p>

<p>Nobody noticed the little girl as she slipped
quietly into the apartment-house, but she did not
take the elevator, fearing the boy—a friendly
person, with whom she had often exchanged remarks—might
ask embarrassing questions.
She preferred to climb the six long flights of
stairs to the Marshes’ apartment on foot. Annie,
the colored maid, opened the door in answer to
her ring, but Annie was not fond of talking, and
Gretel slipped past her, and gained her own room,
without speaking or being spoken to. Once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
there, with the door closed behind her, her first
act was to fling herself face downward on the
bed, and give way to the long-pent-up burst of
tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve been wicked! I’ve been dreadfully
wicked!” sobbed the poor little culprit, as wave
after wave of remorse and shame swept over
her. “I took a ticket to fairy-land that didn’t
belong to me. It was as bad as stealing. I
ought to have taken it back to the box office; I
knew I ought all the time, but I didn’t do it.
Oh, I’m so ashamed—so dreadfully ashamed!”</p>

<p>How long she lay there she did not know, but
gradually the storm subsided; the choking sensation
in her throat relaxed, and she began to
feel more like herself. But she was very unhappy;
more unhappy than she had ever been in
her life. Even when her father died it had not
been like this. Then she had been only sad, not
ashamed, and now she was so ashamed that she
longed to creep away and hide somewhere, where
nobody would ever be able to find her again.</p>

<p>The sound which aroused her at last was the
sudden opening of her door, and Annie’s voice
saying—</p>

<p>“The ladies has come home, and you’re wanted
in the parlor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>It had not taken Annie long to discover that
Gretel was not a person of any particular importance
in the household, and she treated the
child with as little consideration as possible.
She did not even take the trouble to glance into
the room as she delivered the message, but turned
away at once, and went back to her work, while
Gretel rose slowly to her feet, her poor little
guilty heart sinking down, down like a lump of
lead.</p>

<p>“They’ve found out,” was her first thought;
“somebody has told them, and now I’m going
to be punished.”</p>

<p>But somehow even this thought failed to
frighten her much. She was so unhappy already
that it didn’t seem to make any particular difference
what happened to her. She took off her
hat and jacket, and even stopped to smooth her
hair and bathe her swollen eyes. She was a
proud child, and she did not want Mrs. Marsh
and Ada to know that she had been crying.</p>

<p>As Gretel crossed the hall to the parlor, she
became aware of the fact that Mrs. and Miss
Marsh were not alone. Mrs. Marsh was speaking
in her “company voice,” and Ada was giggling
in the affected way she always did when
young gentlemen came to call on her. As Gretel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
neared the parlor door Mrs. Marsh was saying:</p>

<p>“This really is the most delightful surprise.
We had not the least idea you were in this
country.” Then, catching sight of the little girl
in the doorway, she added in her very sweetest
tones—</p>

<p>“Ah, here she is. Come in, Gretel darling,
and see if you can possibly guess who this is.”</p>

<p>Gretel advanced slowly into the room, but she
did not look at the visitor. Her heart was beating
very fast again, and her cheeks were crimson;
she was afraid to lift her eyes from the
carpet.</p>

<p>Then another voice spoke.</p>

<p>“Hello, Gretel,” it said. “Don’t you know
me? Have you quite forgotten your big brother
Percy?”</p>

<p>With a great gasp, Gretel looked up to find
a pair of kindly, merry blue eyes regarding her
earnestly, while their owner, a young man, with
a pleasant sunburnt face, held out his hand to
her. For a moment she was so astonished that
she stood quite still, staring at this sudden apparition,
without even attempting to move or
speak.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Gretel? Why don’t you
speak to your brother?” inquired Mrs. Marsh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
reprovingly, and with another gasp of astonishment,
Gretel came forward, and slipped a cold
little hand into that of the sunburnt stranger.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” she said, timidly. “I—I
thought you were in China.”</p>

<p>“So I was until six weeks ago,” the young
man answered, smiling. “I only arrived in
New York this morning. Aren’t you a little bit
glad to see me?” And greatly to Gretel’s surprise,
this tall, good-looking young gentleman,
bent down and kissed her.</p>

<p>“Yes, oh, yes,” she stammered; “I’m very
glad to see you, only—only—” And all at
once, without having the least idea why, she suddenly
began to cry again.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a baby, Gretel,” remonstrated Ada,
laughing. “If you act like this your brother
will think you are sorry to see him instead of
being glad.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Douane did not seem in the least
offended. He gave Gretel’s shoulder a friendly
pat, and smiled such a kind, understanding smile,
that the little girl’s heart went out to him as it
had not done to any one since the happy days in
the studio.</p>

<p>The evening that followed was so wonderful
that for the time Gretel almost forgot her trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
in astonishment. Her brother did not talk very
much to her, but he made her sit beside him on
the sofa, and all the time he was talking to Mrs.
Marsh and Ada he kept casting kindly glances
at his little sister. She was almost too shy to
answer when he did speak to her, but he seemed
to understand when Mrs. Marsh reproved her
for not telling her brother what a delightful surprise
he had given her, for he interrupted that
lady quite sharply, with the comforting assurance—</p>

<p>“Oh, Gretel’s all right. We understand each
other, don’t we, little girl?” To which Gretel’s
only answer was a rather tremulous smile.</p>

<p>But all the time she was saying over and over
to herself—</p>

<p>“He’s the handsomest, splendidest young
gentleman I’ve ever seen; I think he must look
like the prince in Cinderella, and he’s really my
own brother.”</p>

<p>It really seemed almost too wonderful to be
true. Hitherto she had only thought of this
half-brother of hers as of some faraway benefactor,
who had sent Mrs. Marsh the money for
her board and education, but who was not at all
likely to trouble himself very much more about
her. And now here he was, sitting in Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Marsh’s parlor, apparently taking it as quite a
natural state of affairs that he should have come
all the way home from China, in less than six
weeks, and suddenly dropped down in their
midst.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marsh insisted that the visitor should
remain to dinner.</p>

<p>“You really must, my dear boy,” she protested,
when Mr. Douane seemed inclined to plead
a previous engagement. “I never had the pleasure
of knowing your father, but he was my
dear husband’s favorite cousin, and best friend,
and I feel it a great honor to welcome his son to
my home.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marsh spoke with so much feeling that
her voice trembled, and Gretel thought she must
have loved Mr. Marsh very dearly, but then she
remembered that <i>she</i> was never “Gretel darling”
except before company, and reflected that
perhaps it was the same way about other people
as well. She was “Gretel darling” and “dearest
Gretel” all that evening, and once when she
was passing Mrs. Marsh, that lady suddenly put
an arm round her, and gave her a kiss, which
was such an unusual demonstration of affection
that the little girl fairly gasped with astonishment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
Ada was not so affectionate, but she
talked and laughed a great deal and seemed to
like Mr. Douane very much indeed. She asked
if she might call him Cousin Percy, and seemed
so delighted to have him at home that Gretel was
rather puzzled, for Ada had once told her that
she had not seen Percy Douane since she was a
little girl, and scarcely remembered him at all.</p>

<p>But all these things made but a trifling impression
on Gretel, for her whole attention was
absorbed by her brother. The more she looked
at him, the handsomer she thought him, and
every time he spoke to her, her heart began to
beat so fast that she could scarcely answer him.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say Gretel is very shy,” Mrs.
Marsh remarked to the visitor on one of these
occasions. “We are doing all we can to give
her more confidence in herself, but I am afraid
the life with her father was rather bad for her.
Her training was sadly neglected.”</p>

<p>Gretel felt the hot, indignant color rush up
into her cheeks, but she dared not contradict Mrs.
Marsh. She ventured a timid glance at her
brother, and the expression she saw in his eyes
reassured her.</p>

<p>“My stepfather may not have been a disciplinarian,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
he said, gravely, “but he was one
of the kindest and most generous men I have ever
known.”</p>

<p>“I am sure it is very noble of you to speak so
beautifully of him,” Mrs. Marsh murmured, and
then the subject was changed.</p>

<p>Mr. Douane was not a great talker, but all
that he said was interesting. Ada asked a great
many questions about life in China, and Mrs.
Marsh appeared very anxious to find out why
her cousin had come so unexpectedly.</p>

<p>“I dare say it is only a flying visit,” she said,
smiling, “and that you will be off to the ends
of the earth again before we have had time to
realize we have had a glimpse of you.”</p>

<p>“I am not so sure of that,” said Mr. Douane.
“I may decide to settle down for a while. I had
a bad attack of typhoid in the autumn, and since
then I have had a sort of longing for my own
country. A fellow begins to think about home
and friends when he is too weak to turn over
in bed without assistance.”</p>

<p>“Poor boy,” cried Mrs. Marsh. “I am glad
I did not know of your illness; I should have
been worried to death. But you have quite recovered,
I trust?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>Mr. Douane assured her that he had never
been better in his life.</p>

<p>“The voyage did wonders for me,” he said,
“but I was pretty fit even before I left Hong-Kong.
Indeed, I doubt if I should have come
home at all if some property of my grandfather’s
in Virginia had not required looking after.
Then I had a fancy to see this little sister of
mine; it is more than five years since I saw her
last.”</p>

<p>“You must find her very much changed,” remarked
Ada, to which Mr. Douane replied rather
gravely—</p>

<p>“I do indeed.”</p>

<p>Mr. Douane did not stay long after dinner.
He had an appointment with a friend, he said,
but before leaving he once more drew Gretel to
his side and kissed her.</p>

<p>“Good night, little woman,” he said kindly,
“we shall meet again very soon.” And Gretel
was so overwhelmed with astonishment and rapture,
that she could not think of a single word to
say in reply, and just stood staring after her
brother, as he left the room, accompanied by
Mrs. Marsh and Ada.</p>

<p>She was still standing in the same spot when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
the two ladies returned after seeing their guest to
the elevator.</p>

<p>“Really, Gretel, I am ashamed of you,” began
Mrs. Marsh, and the little girl noticed that she
did not say “Gretel darling” this time. “I am
sure I don’t know what your brother must have
thought of your manners. You scarcely spoke
to him the whole time he was here, and goodness
knows you talk enough at other times.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t have much chance to speak,” faltered
Gretel, anxious to vindicate herself. “You and
Ada were talking all the time, and you told me
never to interrupt.”</p>

<p>“You are a very impertinent little girl,” said
Mrs. Marsh, severely. “I was only anxious to
have you appear well for your own sake. I am
sure your brother must have been very much disappointed
in you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do leave Gretel alone, Mamma,” put in
Ada with a yawn. “I don’t believe Percy cared
whether she talked or not. How could a man
of his age be expected to take any particular interest
in a child like that, even if she is his half-sister?”</p>

<p>But even this last remark failed to disturb
Gretel very much. She was a humble little soul,
and it had never even occurred to her as a possibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
that her faraway, almost unknown
brother, could care much about her. Indeed, she
had not hitherto cared very much about him herself,
except to remember Mrs. Marsh’s oft repeated
injunction to be grateful to her brother,
to whom she owed everything in the world. But
now all that was changed, and he had suddenly
become her hero, the very most interesting person
in the whole world to her.</p>

<p>“He kissed me twice,” she said to herself,
with a little excited thrill, as she went away to
her room, “and he said we should meet soon
again. Oh, I do wonder how soon it will be.”</p>

<p>Then suddenly something that she had almost
forgotten in the excitement of the past few hours
flashed into her mind, and a look that was half
shame and half fear came into her eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she gasped, with a little irrepressible
sob, “he must never find out about ‘Lohengrin.’
He would despise me, and if he knew, I think I
should die of shame.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>GRETEL’S SUNDAY OUT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was Sunday afternoon, and Gretel was at
home alone. Mrs. Marsh had gone to
church, and Ada was spending the afternoon
with friends. It was the maid’s day out,
and Mrs. Marsh had told Gretel that she intended
calling on a friend after church, and if invited,
might remain to supper. Ada did not expect to
return until late in the evening.</p>

<p>“So if neither of us comes home, you can get
your own supper and go to bed early,” the good
lady had added. “You are not afraid to stay
by yourself, are you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” Gretel had answered cheerfully;
“I don’t mind a bit. I’ll read, and—and—do
you think that perhaps my brother might come
again to-day, Mrs. Marsh?”</p>

<p>“I am sure he will not,” said Mrs. Marsh, with
decision. “He must have a good many friends
in New York, and we cannot expect to see much
of him. When he does come again, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
I sincerely hope you will try to make a better
impression than you did yesterday.”</p>

<p>Gretel really did not mind being alone. She
was not a timid child, and the life she had led
with her father had made her unusually independent
for her age. But when Mrs. Marsh had
gone out this afternoon she did not as usual rush
to the piano. Somehow she did not feel quite
like playing to-day. Music reminded her of yesterday,
and it was not a comfortable recollection.
So she went to her room in search of one of her
precious books, and had just settled herself comfortably
with “Little Women” when she was
startled by the sound of the door-bell, and in
spite of Mrs. Marsh’s assurances, her heart began
to beat fast again.</p>

<p>“Hello, Gretel! anybody at home?”</p>

<p>Yes, there he was, her tall handsome brother,
looking down at her with his pleasant smile, and
this time Gretel was not afraid to speak.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry,” she said, regretfully, “but
Mrs. Marsh and Ada have both gone out. Mrs.
Marsh said she was sure you wouldn’t come to-day;
she thought you would have so many other
friends to see.”</p>

<p>She stood holding the door, expecting that the
visitor would go at once, as people usually did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
when told the ladies were not at home, but to
her surprise, he did not move.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to let me in?” he asked,
smiling.</p>

<p>Gretel was covered with confusion.</p>

<p>“Yes, oh, yes, indeed,” she protested eagerly;
“I’d love to have you, but I didn’t think you’d
want to come in when you knew everybody was
out.”</p>

<p>“How about you? Don’t you count yourself
as anybody?” her brother inquired, with a laugh,
as he stepped into the hall, and Gretel closed the
door.</p>

<p>Mr. Douane’s laugh was so pleasant that Gretel
suddenly found herself laughing, too, though
perhaps more from nervousness than enjoyment.</p>

<p>“I’m only a little girl,” she explained, “and
people never come to see me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have come to see you, at any rate,
and to tell the truth, I am very glad Mrs. Marsh
and the fascinating Ada are out. Would you
like to come with me for a motor-ride?”</p>

<p>“A motor-ride?” repeated Gretel, looking
puzzled. “Oh, you don’t mean to go to ride
in an automobile! I should love it better than
anything else in the world, but—but do you
really think I could?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“I don’t see anything to prevent. Do you like
motoring?”</p>

<p>“I have only been in an automobile once,”
Gretel explained. “Father was going to play at
a gentleman’s house in New Rochelle, and the
gentleman sent his car for him, and Father said
I might go, too, and sit outside while he played.
So I did, and we had a lovely ride, but it was
rather cold waiting so long for Father. The car
went so fast I was a little frightened at first, but
I got used to it after a while, and then it was
splendid. But I’m afraid Mrs. Marsh wouldn’t
let me go. You see, the maid is out, too, and
she doesn’t like to have the apartment left with
nobody in it.”</p>

<p>Some of the amusement faded from the visitor’s
face; he even looked a little annoyed.</p>

<p>“So they leave you alone to look after the
house,” he said dryly. “Well, you are not to
stay at home this time, whether Mrs. Marsh objects
or not. I have hired a car for the afternoon,
and I want to take you out with me; it’s
a glorious day. I am your guardian, so it is your
duty to do as I say, and it’s quite time we began
to get acquainted with each other. So run and
get on your warmest things, and I will write
a note explaining matters to Mrs. Marsh. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
apartment will be safe enough; we’ll get the
janitor to look after it.”</p>

<p>Although not feeling at all certain as to how
Mrs. Marsh would regard such an unheard-of
proceeding, Gretel stood far too much in awe of
this big, decided young man to dare argue the
point with him, so without another word, she
turned to do his bidding. She was just leaving
the room when her brother called her back.</p>

<p>“We may stop somewhere for dinner, and not
get back until the evening,” he remarked cheerfully,
“so you may as well put on something
pretty.” He glanced rather disapprovingly as
he spoke at Gretel’s shiny black frock, with the
big darn in the middle of the skirt.</p>

<p>Poor Gretel stopped short, and all the brightness
of anticipation went out of her face. Her
voice even shook a little when she spoke.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry,” she faltered, blushing, “but
I’m really afraid I won’t be able to go. You
see, I haven’t got any pretty things to put on,
and I’m afraid you wouldn’t like to take me in
this dress.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause while Mr. Douane
regarded his little sister critically from top to
toe. Then he gave vent to his feelings in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
long, low whistle. Gretel’s cheeks were crimson,
and she was fighting hard to keep back the rising
tears. But when her brother spoke his voice
was as kind as ever.</p>

<p>“Well, never mind about the clothes,” he said;
“you look very well just as you are. How about
a warm wrap, though? Have you a fur coat?”</p>

<p>Gretel was forced to admit that she had not,
but she assured her brother that her winter
jacket was very warm indeed, and, moreover,
that she never felt cold. Mr. Douane smiled a
rather peculiar smile, but made no further remarks,
and ten minutes later Gretel found herself
leaning back in a comfortable touring-car,
while her brother and the chauffeur wrapped a
warm fur robe about her, tucking her in so snugly
that she felt sure she could not possibly feel cold
even if it should begin to snow.</p>

<p>It was such a wonderful experience that it
took Gretel some time to become accustomed to
it. She scarcely spoke at all during the first
half hour, but it was a beautiful afternoon, and
under the combined effects of bright sunshine,
crisp air, and delightful motion, the little girl’s
spirits soon began to rise, and by the time they
had crossed Seventy-second Street, and were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
bowling up the beautiful Riverside Drive, she was
chattering away to her companion as though she
had known him all her life.</p>

<p>“I’m not a bit frightened this time,” she declared.
“This is something else for me to be
grateful to you for, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said Mr. Douane,
smiling down into the eager, radiant little face;
“why should you be particularly grateful to me
for a motor-ride?”</p>

<p>“Why, because I must be grateful to you for
everything,” said Gretel, innocently. “Mrs.
Marsh says I ought to be even more grateful to
you than I am to her. She says if it wasn’t for
the money you send I should have to go to an
orphan asylum. She would be glad to keep me,
only she is afraid she wouldn’t be able to afford
it.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Mr. Douane, quietly. “So that
is how she explains matters. Well, I must say
I think she might have fitted you out a little better
as regards clothes. I suppose she is kind to
you; you are fond of her, are you not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, she is very kind,” said loyal Gretel,
“and—and I suppose I’m fond of her. I try
to be very grateful all the time; Ada is kind, too;
she gave me ten cents once. Of course it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
pretty hard at first, I missed Father so, but I’m
getting used to it now.”</p>

<p>Gretel wondered why at that moment her
brother suddenly took her hand and patted it.
He did not say anything, but there was a very
kind look in his eyes, and when he spoke next
his voice was unusually gentle.</p>

<p>“Tell me about your school,” he said. “Do
you like going to school and what are your
favorite lessons?”</p>

<p>And Gretel, delighted to find her brother really
interested in her affairs, told him all about the
lessons with Miss Talcott; of that lady’s going
to California, and how Mrs. Marsh had advised
her to try to make herself useful about the house
during her enforced holiday. Mr. Douane listened
very attentively, and although he did not
say much, Gretel felt sure that he was interested.
By dint of a few more questions she was led on
to tell about her daily life and in less than half
an hour Mr. Douane had learned all, and more
than he wanted to know about his little sister’s
life during the past year.</p>

<p>That was a wonderful afternoon, and Gretel
enjoyed every moment. She even told her
brother about Dora, and the visit of Lillie and
Peter, ending with the story of the cream-puffs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
over which Mr. Douane fairly shouted with
laughter.</p>

<p>“It really was rather funny,” said Gretel, who
could not help laughing herself at the recollection
of that dreadful night, “but Mrs. Marsh was
very angry; she says the spots will never come
out of her rug, and it was so sad about Dora’s
having to go away. Dora was such a nice girl,
and it was her first place. Mrs. Marsh wouldn’t
even give her a reference.”</p>

<p>Gretel was beginning to look rather troubled,
but her brother said he was sure Dora would soon
find another place, and then changed the subject
by asking her where she would like to dine.</p>

<p>“There’s a lovely restaurant on Seventh Avenue,”
said Gretel. “Father took me there two
or three times, but perhaps you might think it
was too expensive. They charge seventy-five
cents for the table d’hôte.”</p>

<p>Mr. Douane laughed, and looked so much
amused that Gretel was considerably puzzled.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt it is a very fine restaurant,”
he said, kindly, “but I don’t think we will dine
there this evening. Suppose we try Sherry’s?
I haven’t been there for some years, but it used
to be rather good.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that big place on Fifth Avenue?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
inquired Gretel, her eyes opening wide in
astonishment. “Mr. Pendleton took Mrs. Marsh
and Ada there once, and Ada said the dinner cost
fifteen dollars. Oh, do you really think we ought
to go there?”</p>

<p>Mr. Douane laughed again, and assured her
that he thought they might venture to be extravagant
for once, so when they had made the tour
of Van Cortlandt and The Bronx, the chauffeur
was directed to take them back to the city, and
at about seven o’clock the car drew up before the
big Fifth Avenue restaurant.</p>

<p>“I’ve passed here a great many times, but I
never thought I should be going in,” whispered
Gretel to her brother, as they went up the steps,
and she was conscious of a delightful little thrill
of anticipation.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later they were sitting at a
small table in the brilliantly lighted restaurant,
and Mr. Douane was giving one of the waiters
an order which fairly took away Gretel’s breath;
it was all delightful and beyond her wildest
dreams, but she was a little anxious, notwithstanding.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Gretel?” Mr. Douane
asked, regarding her troubled face curiously, as
the waiter disappeared with the order. “Are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
you afraid you are not going to get enough to
eat?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, indeed!” cried Gretel, reddening;
“it’s all perfectly wonderful, only—only, are
you quite sure you can afford it? It sounded so
very expensive.”</p>

<p>“Quite sure,” laughed her brother. “You
are an economical little person, Gretel.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what Father used to say,” said
Gretel, her face brightening, “but you see, I had
to be rather economical, because Father was so
very extravagant. He didn’t care a bit about
things for himself, but he wanted them to give
to his friends. He used to tell me that if I
didn’t warn him about not spending all his money,
he wouldn’t have any at all left. He said Mother
used to keep his money for him, but after she
died there wasn’t anybody else to do it, and that
was why he was always so poor.”</p>

<p>A shade of sadness passed over Percy Douane’s
pleasant face.</p>

<p>“Poor Mother,” he said, with a sigh, and
Gretel suddenly remembered that her mother was
also his, and felt more intimate with this new
brother of hers than she would have believed possible
a few hours earlier.</p>

<p>What a dinner that was! Gretel had never in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
her life tasted such delicious things. It was
rather too early for the usual crowd, but there
were plenty of diners to watch, and what with
the bright lights, the music, and the delicious
food, the little girl felt very much as Cinderella
must have felt when she first arrived at the ball.
As for the prince, there could not possibly have
been a more delightful prince than her brother.
The night before at Mrs. Marsh’s, she had
thought him rather quiet, but this evening he was
the merriest of companions, and what was more,
he seemed to be enjoying himself quite as much
as Gretel was. Gretel had been accustomed to
the society of grown-up people all her life, and
was in many ways old for her age. She had
been her father’s friend and companion at an age
when most children are still in the nursery, and
even the year spent under Mrs. Marsh’s stern
discipline had failed to altogether suppress her
love of talking. So she chattered away, and by
the time dinner was over Mr. Douane had
learned a good many things, some of which were
of such a surprising nature that he found considerable
difficulty in restraining his rising indignation.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me that Mrs. Marsh
never bought you a Christmas present with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
money I sent?” he inquired once, in a tone of so
much surprise that Gretel was a little startled.</p>

<p>“Did you really send money to buy me a
Christmas present?” she asked innocently.
“How very kind you were. Mrs. Marsh didn’t
tell me about it, but perhaps she forgot. I suppose
she couldn’t spend the money that way, because—well,
you see, she said she didn’t believe
you had any idea how much things cost. I’m
very glad you told me, though, for it makes
another thing for me to be grateful about.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to me about being grateful, Gretel;
I don’t like it.” Mr. Douane spoke so sharply
that Gretel was very much embarrassed, but the
next moment her brother was smiling again, and
had said something to make her laugh.</p>

<p>She felt a little uneasy again when she saw the
size of the bill her brother handed the waiter,
and the small amount of change which was returned
to him, but she was beginning to realize
that Percy did not like being reproved for extravagance,
so she wisely said nothing, although
she could not help an uncomfortable fear that he
might be obliged to go without breakfast the next
morning, as her father had sometimes done.</p>

<p>There was just one subject that Gretel never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
mentioned once all that afternoon and evening,
and that was “fairy-land.” When the orchestra
played popular airs, and her brother asked her if
she cared for music, she said “Yes” in a rather
low voice, and instantly became very much absorbed
in her ice-cream. Music was the one
thing about which she did not want to talk, or
even to think just then. The more she saw of
her brother, and the more she loved and admired
him, the less possible it seemed that she could
ever tell him about the ticket to fairy-land.</p>

<p>It was not yet nine o’clock when Gretel reached
home. She and her brother had walked the few
blocks from Sherry’s to the apartment-house and
the little girl had found the walk through the
brightly-lighted city streets with her tall companion
very pleasant. She had rather hoped to
find the Marshes still out, but the elevator-boy
informed them that Mrs. Marsh had already
reached home.</p>

<p>“Her friend can’t have asked her to stay to
supper, then,” said Gretel, regretfully. “I’m
afraid she’ll scold a good deal, but you’ll explain
about it all, won’t you, Percy?”</p>

<p>“I certainly will explain,” said Mr. Douane,
and his tone sounded so determined that Gretel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
felt much relieved, even though her brother was
looking rather stern, and not nearly as pleasant
as he had looked at the restaurant.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Marsh herself who opened the
door, neither Ada nor the colored maid having as
yet returned. She was smiling, and greeted Mr.
Douane in her “company voice,” but there was
something in the glance she gave Gretel, which
caused the child’s heart to sink with a foreboding
of trouble to come.</p>

<p>But Percy Douane did not waste much time in
explanations or apologies.</p>

<p>“I took Gretel for a motor-ride, and afterwards
we dined at Sherry’s,” he said, quite as if
such unheard-of proceedings were matters of
every-day occurrence. “I hope you found the
note I left for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, thank you; the janitor gave it to me
as soon as I came in. It was a great treat for
the dear child. I am sure you have had a delightful
time, Gretel.”</p>

<p>“It was beautiful,” said Gretel, with shining
eyes. “I’m sorry you had to get supper all by
yourself, though,” she added, regretfully. “I
hoped that lady you went to see would ask you
to stay. You said—”</p>

<p>“Oh, I managed quite comfortably,” interrupted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Mrs. Marsh, frowning. “I am glad you
have had such a happy day, but it is past your
bedtime now, so bid your brother good night, and
run off at once. I am afraid you don’t know
much about children’s bedtime, Cousin Percy.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” said Mr. Douane, rather
grimly, “but Gretel and I have had a jolly evening,
and we are going to have another very soon.
Good night, little woman.” And he drew his little
sister to him, and kissed her with more tenderness
than he himself would have believed possible
a few hours earlier.</p>

<p>“Good night,” said Gretel, returning her
brother’s kiss heartily. “You said I mustn’t talk
about being grateful, but I am just the same.
I’ve had a perfectly wonderful time.” And then,
warned by an impatient gesture from Mrs. Marsh,
she hurried away to her own little room.</p>

<p>“And now, Mrs. Marsh, I wish to have a little
talk with you,” said Mr. Douane, as Gretel’s door
closed behind her, and there was that in his tone
which caused that lady to tremble, and turn rather
pale, as she silently led the way to the parlor.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>A TRANSFORMED CINDERELLA</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MRS. MARSH did not appear at the
breakfast table the next morning.
She had a bad headache, Annie told
Gretel, and was having her coffee in bed. Gretel
had nearly finished her own breakfast, when Ada,
still in wrapper and curling-pins, came sauntering
into the dining-room.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mamma?” she inquired, with a
yawn, as she took her place at the table.</p>

<p>“She has a headache,” Gretel explained;
“Annie took her some coffee and toast on a tray.”</p>

<p>Ada looked more interested.</p>

<p>“Something’s up,” she remarked, helping herself
to an orange. “Do you know what it is,
Gretel?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Gretel, looking very much surprised;
“she didn’t say there was anything the
matter last night. Oh, Ada, I had such a perfectly
beautiful time. Percy came for me to go
for a motor-ride with him. He says I must call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
him Percy, though I don’t think it sounds quite
polite, when he’s so much older than I am. We
had a wonderful ride, and then we went to
Sherry’s and—”</p>

<p>“I felt sure there was something wrong when
I came home last night,” Ada went on, without
paying the slightest attention to Gretel’s news.
“Mamma was in her room, and wouldn’t open the
door when I spoke to her. I thought her voice
sounded queer, and she seemed very cross. I do
hope it isn’t any more bother about money; we’re
poor enough already, goodness knows. I’ll go
in and get it out of her, whatever it is, as soon as
I’ve finished my breakfast.”</p>

<p>As Ada had not proved a sympathetic listener,
Gretel refrained from any further information
about her own affairs, and in a few minutes she
went away to make her bed, leaving Miss Marsh
to finish her breakfast alone.</p>

<p>Bed-making is not an easy task for a girl of
eleven, especially when there is a heavy mattress,
which one has had strict injunctions to turn every
morning. Gretel had only this duty to perform
since the arrival of Annie, who had pronounced
the work much too hard, and insisted on having
help. But Gretel was an orderly little soul, who
rather enjoyed housework, and when she made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
her own bed she had at least the satisfaction of
getting her room in order in the morning, instead
of waiting till afternoon, which had sometimes
been the case during Dora’s reign. She had just
finished her dusting when her door—which she
had closed—was flung suddenly open, and Ada,
looking both flushed and excited, appeared on the
threshold.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve done it!” remarked that young
lady in a tone of such exasperation, that innocent
Gretel regarded her in amazement.</p>

<p>“Done what?” she inquired, stupidly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess you know well enough. It’s all
very well to pretend you don’t, but I don’t believe
you’re quite such a baby as you appear to be, after
all.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t know, indeed I don’t,” protested
Gretel. “I didn’t think I had done anything
wrong, except—oh!” And Gretel stopped
short, with a little frightened gasp, and some of
the color went out of her face.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you haven’t done anything wrong; of
course not,” said Ada, sarcastically. “It wasn’t
wrong to tell wicked stories to that brother of
yours, and prejudice him against Mamma.
You’re a mean little tell-tale, and you deserve to
be severely punished.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>The color had all flown back into Gretel’s
cheeks by this time, and though very much distressed,
she was no longer frightened. Ada’s
words had at least assured her that her first great
fear was groundless.</p>

<p>“I didn’t tell my brother wicked stories,” she
protested, indignantly. “I don’t know what you
mean, Ada, I truly don’t.”</p>

<p>There was such a ring of truth in Gretel’s voice
that Ada—who was not really an unkind girl at
heart—was somewhat mollified.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve made a lot of trouble, whether
you meant to or not,” she said, with a sigh.
“Mamma hasn’t closed her eyes all night, and
she’s in an awful state this morning. Don’t you
know it’s very mean to tell people’s private affairs
to any one, even if he is your brother?”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t tell Mrs. Marsh’s private affairs
to Percy,” cried Gretel, her voice beginning to
tremble. “I don’t know her private affairs, so I
couldn’t tell them, even if I wanted to. I didn’t
tell Percy about anybody but just myself.”</p>

<p>Before Ada could answer Mrs. Marsh’s voice
sounded down the hall.</p>

<p>“Ada, come here, I want to speak to you.
Can’t you leave that child alone? I should think
mischief enough had been done already.” And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
without another word, Ada turned away, slamming
the door behind her.</p>

<p>Left alone, Gretel stood quite still in the middle
of the room, staring at the closed door. She had
not the least idea what all the trouble was about,
but one thing was painfully clear; in some way,
quite unintentionally on her part, she had offended
Mrs. Marsh, and made her very angry.
She was not fond of Mrs. Marsh, but she did not
want any one to be angry with her. She was
quite sure she had not told her brother any wicked
stories, but if he thought she had, and had told
Mrs. Marsh so, what could she do? She was
only a little girl, and nobody could be expected to
believe her word against the word of a grown-up
person, but why, oh, why, had Percy—her beloved
Percy—said such cruel, untrue things
about her? He had been so kind, and had really
seemed to like her, but if he said she told wicked
stories he could not possibly like her. It must
have been all a mistake on her part. Suddenly a
great wave of disappointment and loneliness
swept over the poor little girl, and with a sob, she
flung herself face downward on the bed, just as
she had done on the day when she came back from
fairy-land, and began to cry as if her heart would
break.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>Again it was Annie who disturbed her by opening
the door, and putting in her head, with almost
the very same words she had used on that other
occasion: “You’re wanted in the parlor.” And
having delivered this curt message, went away
again, leaving the door open.</p>

<p>Gretel rose slowly, and pushed the tumbled hair
back from her face. She had been crying so
hard that her head ached, and she felt rather
giddy and confused. But this time she did not
wait to bathe her face before answering the summons.
If Mrs. Marsh wanted to scold her, it
might be as well to let her get through with it
as soon as possible, and that lady did not like to be
kept waiting.</p>

<p>Gretel did not look up when she entered the
parlor. She was such a forlorn little figure, in
her shabby frock, her face all tear-stained and
swollen from crying that the young man standing
on the rug by the mantelpiece, was conscious of
a momentary feeling of something very like dismay.
But when Gretel saw who was the sole
occupant of the room, and ran to him with a little
cry, his face softened, and it was with real tenderness
that he put his arm round her, saying
gently:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“What’s the matter, Gretel? Tell me all about
it.”</p>

<p>But, to Mr. Douane’s surprise, Gretel did not
respond to his caress; she even drew a little away
from him, and the big brown eyes were full of
a mute reproach.</p>

<p>“What made you say it?” she asked in a voice
that was not much above a whisper.</p>

<p>“Say what?” her brother inquired, curiously.</p>

<p>“Tell Mrs. Marsh I told wicked stories, and
that I was a—a tell-tale?” finished Gretel, with
a sob.</p>

<p>Percy Douane’s face grew very stern, and his
eyes flashed ominously.</p>

<p>“Who said I told her any such things?” he
demanded in a voice that fairly made Gretel
tremble.</p>

<p>“Ada said so; she said I told you her mother’s
private affairs, but I didn’t; you know I didn’t.
I only told you about myself. Oh, Percy dear,
won’t you please tell them you made a mistake?
Mrs. Marsh is so very angry, and Ada’s angry
too.”</p>

<p>“Gretel,” said her brother, and he made a great
effort to speak quietly, “go and put on your hat
and jacket; I want you to come out with me.”</p>

<p>Gretel was very much surprised, but she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
pleased as well. It was a great relief to know
that she would not have to encounter Mrs.
Marsh’s wrath just yet, and even if her brother
did accuse her of telling people’s private affairs,
his society was infinitely preferable to that of
either Ada or the maid Annie.</p>

<p>“Where are we going?” she inquired, regarding
her brother’s grave face, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Never mind; I’ll tell you later. Run and put
on your things.”</p>

<p>“But oughtn’t I to ask Mrs. Marsh first? She
doesn’t like to have people go out without letting
her know.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Marsh knows all about it; I told her last
night. Now hurry, like a good child; I want to
get away from here as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>Gretel was very much puzzled. She felt sure
that something unusual had happened, but what
it was she had not the slightest idea. Without
another word she turned, and went back to her
room; put on her hat and jacket, and in less than
five minutes was back at her brother’s side again.
Mrs. Marsh’s door was closed, and neither she
nor her daughter was to be seen. Gretel paused
for a moment outside the closed door, on her way
back to the parlor. She could hear the sound of
low, agitated voices from within but she dared not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
linger for fear of making her brother more angry
than he appeared to be already.</p>

<p>Mr. Douane was standing by the parlor table,
hastily writing a note, when Gretel rejoined him.</p>

<p>“I am leaving this for Mrs. Marsh,” he said;
“she will understand everything when she reads
it. Are you ready?”</p>

<p>Gretel nodded.</p>

<p>“Come along, then; I have a taxi waiting at the
door.”</p>

<p>Gretel’s heart was beating very fast as she followed
her brother into the elevator, but she did
not ask any questions until they had left the apartment-house,
and were rattling away in a taxi.
Percy had given the chauffeur an address, but
Gretel was too much astonished and bewildered
by this sudden turn of affairs to notice what it
was. But when her brother suddenly began to
laugh his pleasant, jolly laugh, and put his arm
round her again, she began to realize that this was
a most exciting adventure, and, moreover, that
she was not at all frightened.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s over!” exclaimed Mr. Douane,
in a tone of unmistakable relief. “We actually
succeeded in getting away without encountering
the ogress. How do you like being carried off
in this sudden fashion, Gretel?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“I think I’m beginning to like it,” said Gretel,
whose spirits were rising rapidly, “but where are
we going, and who is the ogress?”</p>

<p>“We are going first to the ‘Gotham’—the
hotel where I am putting up for the present.
Later we are going to Virginia.”</p>

<p>“Virginia!” repeated Gretel, staring at her
brother in blank amazement. “You said last
night that you were going to Virginia, but—but
I never thought I was going with you.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are—that is unless you have any
very serious objections. I have got to look after
some property of my grandfather’s, and have decided
to take you along with me. We will stay
at Old Point Comfort; you will like it there, and
it is only a few miles from my old home. You
know I lived in Virginia with my grandfather for
some years before I went to China. It will be
fine to get away from these cold March winds;
I’m not accustomed to cold weather in Hong-Kong.
What do you think of my plan?”</p>

<p>“It’s the most exciting thing that ever happened
to me,” declared Gretel, who was still both
looking and feeling decidedly bewildered. “I
feel as if I must be dreaming, but—but I’m
afraid I can’t go without some more clothes. I
didn’t even bring a tooth-brush.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“We’ll attend to the clothes all right, so don’t
worry about that. We are not starting till to-morrow
afternoon, and there will be plenty of
time to fit you out before then. I’ve had a talk
with the housekeeper at my hotel. She seems a
good soul, and thinks she knows of a suitable maid
to look after you.”</p>

<p>“A maid to look after me!” Gretel felt more
convinced than ever that she must be dreaming.
“Why, I thought only rich people had maids; I
never even had a nurse after I was five. Father
did everything for me himself. Oh, Percy dear,
I really don’t think I need a maid; it would cost
so much, and I can do everything for myself now.
Even Mrs. Marsh says I’m not much trouble.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Douane only laughed.</p>

<p>“You’ll have a lot of things to learn, Pussy,”
he said, pinching her cheek. “I presume it is
something of a shock just at first, but I’ve had a
rather severe shock myself. If any one had told
me at this hour yesterday, that I should be
carrying you off with me to Old Point, I should
have been inclined to think it a rather poor joke.
But I’ve had my eyes opened since then. Mrs.
Marsh hasn’t been playing fair. She and I had
a settling-up of accounts last night, and I gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
her a piece of my mind that I don’t believe she
will forget in a hurry.”</p>

<p>Gretel was beginning to understand.</p>

<p>“Is that why Ada was so cross?” she asked.
“And why she said those horrid things about my
being a tell-tale and talking about Mrs. Marsh’s
private affairs? But I didn’t really tell you anything
I ought not; did I, Percy?”</p>

<p>“You certainly did not. You told me nothing
but the simple truth, but that was quite enough.
I never knew Mrs. Marsh well, but her husband
was a fine man, and a great friend of my father’s,
and I thought I could trust her to do what was
right by you. I have found out my mistake, and
for the future I shall steer clear of that charming
lady and her daughter.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean I’m not to go back to Mrs.
Marsh’s at all?” questioned Gretel.</p>

<p>“Do you want to go back?”</p>

<p>“N—no, not at all, but if I don’t live with
Mrs. Marsh, who is going to take care of me?”</p>

<p>“I am, for the present, until I can make some
other arrangement for you. Don’t look so distressed,
little woman; are you afraid I won’t be
able to look after you properly?”</p>

<p>“No, oh, no,” cried Gretel, eagerly. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
should love to live with you, only—only it’s all
been so very sudden, and if I had known I wasn’t
coming back I could have taken my things.”</p>

<p>“What things?” her brother asked, kindly.</p>

<p>“Father’s picture, and his letters, and my
books. Oh, do you think Mrs. Marsh will let me
have them? I should be so very unhappy without
Father’s letters.”</p>

<p>Mr. Douane assured her that all her possessions
should be sent to her, and he spoke in a tone of
so much conviction, that Gretel’s spirits began to
rise very rapidly, and by the time the taxi drew
up before the big Fifth Avenue hotel, she was as
happy, and as eager for new adventures as any
little girl starting on her first journey could possibly
be.</p>

<p>They went up a great many stories in an elevator,
walked along a wide corridor, with doors on
both sides, and finally entered a sitting-room,
which was so high up that Gretel could see over
the tops of the neighboring houses, and even catch
a glimpse of the boats on the river. Here her
brother told her to take off her jacket, and make
herself comfortable, while he rang the bell for
the housekeeper.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the housekeeper appeared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
accompanied by a stout young woman, with very
red hair, and a rather pleasant face.</p>

<p>“This is the maid I mentioned to you, sir,” the
housekeeper explained. “I telephoned to her at
once, and found she was still out of a place. She
hasn’t been very long in this country, but I know
her people at home in England, and she can show
you some excellent references from our best families.”</p>

<p>The young woman then stepped forward with
a courtesy, and Gretel noticed that she looked
kind, although she was not at all handsome.</p>

<p>“Is this the little girl, sir?” the housekeeper
went on, glancing rather curiously at Gretel’s
shabby frock, and the hat that looked decidedly
the worse for wear.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is my little sister,” said Mr. Douane.
“Would you mind taking her to her room, Mrs.
Ruggles?”</p>

<p>So while Mr. Douane questioned the maid, and
examined her credentials, Mrs. Ruggles, the
housekeeper, took Gretel to an adjoining room,
which she told the little girl her brother had engaged
for her. It was a large bedroom, and there
was a bath connecting with it, at sight of which
Gretel’s eyes opened wider than ever, but she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
almost reached the point where nothing further
could surprise her. If her brother had suddenly
changed into a fairy prince, and she herself, been
transformed into an enchanted princess, she
would have regarded it as quite a natural state of
affairs. The housekeeper was evidently very
much interested in her, and she asked a great
many questions, which Gretel was almost too
much bewildered to answer. But in a few
minutes Mr. Douane appeared, smiling, and looking
decidedly relieved. He was accompanied by
the maid, who was also looking very well pleased.</p>

<p>“Gretel,” he said, “this is Higgins; she is going
to look after you, and will go with us to Virginia.”</p>

<p>Gretel came forward, and held out her hand.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” she said politely; “are
you Miss Higgins or Mrs. Higgins?”</p>

<p>“Just ’Iggins, if you please, miss,” said the
maid, smiling, and beaming all over her plain,
honest face. “I prefer being called by my last
name. It’s quite customary with hupper servants
in Hengland, miss.”</p>

<p>Gretel thought it was very odd to call a lady by
her last name, but then there were so many odd
things happening to her that morning, that one
surprise more or less did not seem to make much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
difference. So she accepted the situation without
any further argument.</p>

<p>“You are to go shopping with Higgins,” Mr.
Douane went on to explain. “You will need a
good many things before we leave for Old Point
to-morrow afternoon. Mrs. Ruggles has kindly
offered to go with you, and show Higgins the
best shops. I have explained what I want you to
have, and I think we may leave the selection to
her.”</p>

<p>“That you may, sir,” put in Higgins, cheerfully.
“I was lady’s maid for two years in Lord
Carresford’s family, and I think I know what’s
proper in the way of clothes for a young lady.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mr. Douane; “I will leave
everything to you and Mrs. Ruggles. As I said
before, you need not spare expense. I want my
little sister to be as well dressed as any child of
her age should be. I don’t know much about
such things, but you women do, so I will leave her
in your hands for the day. I have some business
to attend to downtown, but I shall be back this
afternoon. Is it all right, Gretel?”</p>

<p>Gretel nodded; speech did not come easily just
then, and ten minutes later, she, Mrs. Ruggles,
and Higgins were rattling down Fifth Avenue in
a taxi, bound on a shopping expedition, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
thought of which filled the two women with delightful
anticipation.</p>

<p>It was nearly six o’clock before Mr. Douane
returned to the hotel. As he entered his private
sitting-room a little figure, which had been standing
by the window, sprang forward to greet him.</p>

<p>“Look at me,” cried Gretel; “oh, look at me!”
And that was really all she could say.</p>

<p>And Mr. Douane did look at her, and the more
he looked, the more surprised he became. Indeed
it was hard to recognize the shabby, forlorn little
girl of the morning, in the radiant, prettily dressed
child before him. Gretel’s hair—which usually
hung in two long pigtails, had been combed out,
and now fell in soft ringlets over her shoulders;
she wore a pretty, well-fitting white dress, and
altogether, the change in her appearance was so
astonishing, that for the first few moments her
brother could do nothing but hold her off at
arm’s length, and stare at her in silence.</p>

<p>“Why, Gretel,” he exclaimed, finding his voice
at last, “I declare you are pretty,” and he looked
so very much surprised that Gretel could not help
thinking her brother must have considered her
anything but pretty hitherto.</p>

</figure>

<p>“I’m so glad you like me,” she said, blushing.
“I think my dress is lovely, and I’ve got ever so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>many others besides. Oh, Percy, it has been such
a wonderful day! Mrs. Ruggles and Higgins
were so kind and we went to such beautiful stores,
and bought such quantities of things. I was sure
we must be spending too much money, but Higgins
said you told her to get everything she
thought I ought to have, and she seemed to think
I needed a great many things, and so did Mrs.
Ruggles.”</p>

<p>“They were quite right,” said her brother,
smiling. “I want my little sister to be as well
dressed as any other little girl we may meet on
our travels. You really look very fit indeed,
Gretel; I compliment Higgins on her good taste.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she has beautiful taste!” cried Gretel,
enthusiastically. “You see, she lived in a castle
in England, and used to dress the young ladies
when they went to dinners and balls. I never
had such beautiful clothes in my life, and I love
them, only—only I don’t see how I can ever be
quite grateful enough to you for giving me so
many wonderful things.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Gretel,” said her brother, seriously,
and he sat down, and lifted her on his
knee. “You are not to think any more about
being grateful to me, and all that rubbish. You
are my own little sister, and what is mine is yours.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
I have far more money than I need for myself,
and it is my pleasure, as well as my duty, to see
that you have everything you ought to have. We
are going to be chums, so I don’t want to hear any
more about gratitude. Just be happy, and try to
like your big brother a little, and it will be all
right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do like you, indeed I do. I love you
better than I ever loved anybody except Father,”
cried Gretel, with her arms round her brother’s
neck. “I’ll try to be good always, and do everything
you want me to, and—and I think perhaps
I’d better tell you something. It’s very dreadful,
and you may not like me any more when you
know about it, but I really think I ought to tell
you.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a thing is it?” Mr. Douane
asked, as he held his little sister close, and looked
down smilingly into the child’s troubled face.</p>

<p>“It’s something I did that was very wicked,”
whispered Gretel, hiding her crimson face on his
shoulder. “It’s very hard to talk about it.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t talk about it,” said Percy, laughing
and kissing her. “I really don’t think I care
to know. Come, cheer up, and tell me some more
about your shopping expedition. Where did you
go for lunch?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>Gretel gave a great sigh of relief. Her brother
would never know from what a humiliating confession
his kind words had saved her.</p>

<p>“I’ll be so good all the rest of my life that perhaps
it won’t matter so very much,” she said to
herself when she had gone to bed that night.
“Perhaps sometime when I’m grown up I shall
be able to earn enough money to buy some poor
person a ticket to fairy-land, and then I won’t
feel quite so mean and ashamed whenever I think
about last Saturday.”</p>

<p>So Gretel silenced conscience, which still persisted
in whispering that it would have been better
to have told her brother the whole story, and fell
asleep, happier than she had ever been since the
old days in the studio with her father. As for
Mr. Douane himself, he had already forgotten all
about the matter.</p>

<p>“She is a dear little thing,” he said to himself,
as he sat smoking in the sitting-room after Gretel
had left him for the night. “I didn’t quite know
what I was in for this morning, but I needn’t have
worried so much. I shall have to send the child
to some good school before long, I suppose, but in
the meantime I believe I am going to rather enjoy
having her with me.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>JERRY AND GERALDINE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was a glorious spring morning about a week
later, and Gretel and Higgins were sitting on
the pier at Old Point Comfort, watching the
departure of a big battle-ship, which was just
sailing out of the harbor. At their feet lay the
beautiful bay, the little waves sparkling and dancing
in the bright sunshine. In New York it was
still winter, and piles of snow were melting in the
parks, but here in Virginia spring had already
come; the birds were singing, and the grass was
as green as if it had been June instead of the last
of March.</p>

<p>Although it was only a little more than a week
since Gretel had left Mrs. Marsh’s, she already
looked quite a different child. There was a
color in her cheeks, and a brightness in her eyes,
which it did her brother’s heart good to see, and
as for her appetite, she felt quite certain she had
never eaten so much in her life. She was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
happy, and enjoying every new experience and
sensation to the full. As yet they had not made
any friends at the big hotel, but there was so
much to see, and so many pleasant things to do,
Gretel had not even thought of other companionship
than that of her brother and Higgins. Mr.
Douane was growing very fond of his little sister,
and he was so kind to her, and so anxious to give
her pleasure, that Gretel sometimes felt as if this
wonderful new life must be a dream, from which
she must surely wake some morning, to find herself
back in her little room at Mrs. Marsh’s, with
nothing more exciting to look forward to than
watching the people going into “fairy-land.”</p>

<p>Higgins was not a very interesting person, it
is true, but she too was kind, and she treated the
little girl with so much deference and respect, that
Gretel was sometimes quite embarrassed.</p>

<p>“I wish Higgins wouldn’t say ‘Miss’ every
time she speaks to me,” she had said to her
brother once when they were alone together. At
which Mr. Douane had only laughed, and told her
that it was quite customary for maids to address
young ladies as “Miss.”</p>

<p>Higgins herself had taken a great fancy to the
gentle little girl, who always treated her with
kindness and consideration, and to dress Gretel in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
her prettiest clothes, curl her hair, and take her
to walk, were among her favorite occupations.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Higgins,” remarked Gretel, as
the battle-ship faded out of sight, “you’ve never
told me what your other name is.”</p>

<p>Higgins blushed and looked a little embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, miss,” she explained, “I
don’t use it very hoften; it don’t seem hexactly
suitable. It was this way, miss. My mother
before she married was lady’s maid in Sir Marmaduke
Cadwalader’s family. ’Er ladyship was
very kind, and my mother thought a great deal of
’er in a respectful way, so when I was born she
named me for Lady Cadwalader’s second daughter.
’Er ladyship was pleased when she ’eard of
it, and Miss Violet ’erself sent me a mug and
spoon.”</p>

<p>“Miss Violet,” repeated Gretel; “is your name
Violet, Higgins?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” Higgins admitted reluctantly,
“and I must say I don’t like it. Violet ’Iggins
don’t seem to go rightly together, does it now?
That’s why I prefer to be called just ’Iggins.”</p>

<p>“Violet is a very beautiful name,” said Gretel,
politely. “I never knew any one named Violet
before, but I’ve read it in books.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“You never read about a Violet ’Iggins,
though, did you?” inquired Higgins, rather
grimly. And Gretel was forced to admit that she
had not.</p>

<p>“I’ll call you Violet if you would like to have
me,” she said, eagerly. “I needn’t do it before
people if you prefer Higgins, but I should think
you would like to have somebody intimate enough
with you to call you by your first name. I should
hate to have everybody call me Schiller.”</p>

<p>“It’s very kind of you, I’m sure, miss,” said
Higgins, who was still looking somewhat embarrassed,
“but hif you don’t mind, I think I’d
just as soon be ’Iggins. You see, nobody ever
did call me Violet. My mother thought hit was
too grand a name to use without a miss before it,
so she shortened it to Sally. I was halways called
Sally at ’ome, but since I’ve been in service I’ve
halways stipulated that I should be called ’Iggins.”</p>

<p>Gretel was a little disappointed. She really liked
Higgins, and was anxious to be friends with her,
but it did not seem possible to become very intimate
with a person who must always be addressed
by her last name. But at that moment she
caught sight of her brother approaching her, accompanied
by a lady and gentleman.</p>

<p>“Oh, look, Higgins,” she exclaimed, eagerly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
“here comes Percy, and he’s talking to the father
and mother of those children we saw at the fort
yesterday. You know the little boy and girl we
thought must be twins, they looked so much
alike.”</p>

<p>“I remember,” said Higgins, disapprovingly,
“and very hill-mannered children they was, too.
There they are now, hout on the very hend of the
pier; they’ll be tumbling into the water and getting
themselves drowned the next thing.”</p>

<p>At that moment Mr. Douane reached his little
sister’s side, and stopped to speak to her.</p>

<p>“Gretel,” he said, “I have met some old
friends, Mr. and Mrs. Barlow. I have been telling
them about you, and they say they will be glad
to have you make friends with their little daughter,
who is about your age.”</p>

<p>Gretel rose and curtsied.</p>

<p>“I shall be very glad to know your little
daughter,” she said, speaking in the prim foreign
way her father had taught her, “but I think she
must be younger than I am. I have seen her and
the little boy, too. I shall be twelve years old
next August.”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Barlow looked rather amused,
but they shook hands with Gretel very kindly, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
Mr. Barlow—who was a stout, pleasant-faced
gentleman—said she was quite correct, and that
the twins were only just ten.</p>

<p>“Are they really twins?” inquired Gretel,
with much interest. “Higgins and I thought
they might be, but we weren’t sure. I think I
see them out on the end of the pier now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Mr. Barlow, following Gretel’s
glance, “they certainly are, and a little too
near the end, I am afraid.” And he started
promptly in pursuit of his small son and daughter.
But Mrs. Barlow—a placid, sweet-faced
little lady—smiled serenely, and did not seem
in the least anxious.</p>

<p>“Mr. Barlow is always worrying about the
children,” she said. “I tell him he is very foolish;
Jerry and Geraldine are perfectly capable of
taking care of themselves. Besides, children must
be taught to learn by experience. We must not
put the thought of fear into their little minds.
My Jerry is the most fearless child I have ever
known.”</p>

<p>Mr. Douane looked a little puzzled, as if he
found it rather hard to understand Mrs. Barlow’s
point of view, but at that moment Mr. Barlow
returned, accompanied by Jerry and Geraldine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“Children,” began Mrs. Barlow in her sweet,
rather drawling voice, “such a very pleasant
thing has happened. We have met an old friend,
Mr. Douane, and his little sister is going to be
a dear little playmate for you. Isn’t that delightful
news?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barlow evidently expected the children
to be quite overwhelmed with joy, but to tell the
truth, neither Jerry nor Geraldine appeared very
much impressed. They both regarded Gretel
with a prolonged stare, but neither spoke, and
when Gretel held out her hand, Jerry instantly
put both hands in his pockets, and Geraldine put
hers behind her back.</p>

<p>“Shake hands, children,” admonished their
father; “don’t you see the little girl is waiting
to shake hands with you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t force them, dear,” Mrs. Barlow
interposed gently. “Children always get on better
together when left to themselves. We are
going to the fort for guard mount, Mr. Douane,
and shall be very glad to have your little sister
join us. Please let her come.”</p>

<p>Mr. Douane said he was sure Gretel would
be glad to go, and added that he himself, was
obliged to go away for the day, to attend to
some business in the neighborhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“Then why not let your sister spend the day
with us?” exclaimed Mrs. Barlow. “That will
be a charming plan, and the children will be so
happy. We have only been here two days, and
they have not had an opportunity of making any
little friends as yet. You are staying at the
‘Chamberlain,’ I suppose?”</p>

<p>Mr. Douane replied that they were.</p>

<p>“We go there for our meals,” said Mrs. Barlow,
“but have taken a cottage for the season.
The children are just over scarlet fever, and are
not to return to school this spring. Would you
like to spend the day with us, dear?” she added,
kindly, turning to Gretel.</p>

<p>Gretel said she would like it very much.</p>

<p>“Very well, then, you shall come with us to
the fort, and afterwards go back to the cottage.
We shall all have a very happy day, I am sure,
Mr. Douane.”</p>

<p>So the matter was settled, and a few minutes
later Gretel was walking away to the fort with
her new friends, while Mr. Douane hurried off to
catch his train, and Higgins was left to return
to the hotel by herself.</p>

<p>“Now, children, you are all to walk together,
and make friends,” said Mrs. Barlow, taking command
of the party, and accordingly the three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
children started on ahead, while their elders
brought up the rear.</p>

<p>For several minutes they walked on in perfect
silence. Jerry and Geraldine were regarding
their new acquaintance critically, and Gretel was
beginning to wonder if both her companions
could possibly be dumb, when Geraldine at last
broke silence with the question:</p>

<p>“Did you come in the boat?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Gretel, delighted at finding
an opening for conversation; “we came on the
Norfolk steamer from New York; it was lovely.”</p>

<p>“We came by the train,” announced Geraldine;
“I hate trains, and so does Jerry; they’re so hot
and stuffy. We wanted to come by the boat, and
Father was willing, but Mother wasn’t. Were
you seasick?”</p>

<p>“No, not a bit. My brother and I sat on deck,
and there was music, and we had such a good
dinner. Higgins and I both slept so soundly
that my brother had to wake us when it was time
to get up in the morning. I was never on a
steamer before, but I loved it.”</p>

<p>“Of course you did,” said Geraldine, with conviction;
“we should have loved it, too. We’re
going on a boat sometime, aren’t we, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Yep,” responded Jerry, shortly. It was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
first time he had spoken, and his voice was so
very hoarse that Gretel looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Has your brother a bad cold?” she inquired
sympathetically of Geraldine.</p>

<p>“It’s his tonsils,” Geraldine explained.
“Father says they ought to be cut, but Mother’s
using Mind Cure on him, and she thinks they’ll
get well by themselves.”</p>

<p>“What’s Mind Cure?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you know? It’s the thing people
believe in when they don’t take medicine or have
doctors. We had a doctor when we had scarlet
fever, because Father said we must, but Mother
thought it was all nonsense about the fumigating.
Before Mother got to be a Mind Cure we
had to take castor oil, and rhubarb, and lots of
horrid things, but we never do now. We like it
much better this way. Does your mother bring
you up by the Law of Love?”</p>

<p>“My mother died when I was a baby,” said
Gretel, sadly, “and my father is dead too. My
brother takes care of me now, and he is very kind,
but I don’t think I know what the Law of Love
is.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it means never punishing, and only talking
to you a long time when you’re naughty, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
things like that,” Geraldine explained. “Mother
didn’t know about it till she went to some lectures
last winter. The lady that gave the lectures said
children must never have their spirit broken, and
must learn things by experience. Mother has a
lot of books that tell how to bring children up
that way, and she and the lady who gives the
lectures write to each other about it, too. It’s
great fun being brought up by the Law of Love,
isn’t it, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“You bet!” responded Jerry, heartily. “It’s
great never having to take any more nasty old
medicine, too. Have you got any more of those
chocolates along?”</p>

<p>Geraldine produced from her pocket a small
box of chocolate creams, which she handed to her
brother.</p>

<p>“Have one?” inquired Jerry, holding out the
box to Gretel, and addressing her for the first
time.</p>

<p>Gretel politely accepted a bonbon.</p>

<p>“Before Mother got to be a Mind Cure we
were only allowed one chocolate after dinner,”
Geraldine observed, complacently, putting a fat
cream into her mouth. “Now we can buy all
we want, and Mother says if they make us ill we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
shall learn by experience not to eat too many
again. But they haven’t made us ill yet.”</p>

<p>At that moment they reached the entrance to
the fort, and paused to wait for their elders, who
were some distance behind. Mrs. Barlow greeted
them with her usual serene smile.</p>

<p>“I hope my little boy and girl have been polite,
and kind to their new friend,” she said, and Gretel
thought her voice sounded as if she were reciting
something out of a book. “It is a great
pleasure to have a new friend, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Neither Jerry nor Geraldine appeared to consider
it necessary to answer this question, but
their mother was evidently accustomed to their
silence, for she did not look at all surprised, and
in another moment they were all crossing the
drawbridge into the fort.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>REAL MUSIC</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">GUARD mount was over, and the Barlows
with their guest were on their way back
to their cottage. Gretel had enjoyed the
morning very much. The soldiers, the bright
music, and the crowds of people, had all combined
to make the hour of guard mount a most
delightful occasion. Then, too, she was beginning
to find her new friends very entertaining.
Geraldine chatted away incessantly, and Jerry,
although much less talkative than his twin, was
so amusing that Gretel had found herself laughing
almost every time he opened his lips. Mr.
and Mrs. Barlow had soon been joined by some
acquaintances, and after that the children had
been left pretty much to their own devices. Mr.
Barlow kept a watchful eye upon the twins, but
his wife became so much interested in her conversation
with a friend, that she appeared to forget
all about everything else. Gretel caught
snatches of this conversation, in which the words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
“Montessori System”—“Law of Love” and
“Wonderful Spiritual Experience” were frequently
repeated.</p>

<p>It was when they were walking home from the
fort that Geraldine suddenly remarked in a tone
of regret—</p>

<p>“The parade was nice, wasn’t it? I’m rather
sorry we wouldn’t let Miss Heath come.”</p>

<p>“Who is Miss Heath?” Gretel inquired with
interest.</p>

<p>“She’s our teacher. Mother said we lost so
much time having scarlet fever that we must have
lessons down here, so she brought an old teacher
along.”</p>

<p>“She isn’t old,” declared Jerry, in his hoarse
little voice; “she’s real pretty, and I wanted you
to let her come, but you said it was against rules.”</p>

<p>“Well, so it was,” maintained his sister.
“You see,” she added, by way of explanation to
Gretel, “when Mother said we had to take a
teacher with us, we made an awful row. We
said it wasn’t fair to have to study when we
weren’t in New York, so at last Mother made a
compromise. She said if we promised to study
for two hours every day, we could have all the
rest of the time to ourselves. We needn’t even
see the old teacher if we didn’t want to, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
wasn’t to interfere in anything we did. So when
Miss Heath came, we explained things to her, and
made her sign a paper we wrote out.”</p>

<p>“Did she mind?” Gretel asked. She was
thinking that Miss Talcott might have rather enjoyed
such an arrangement.</p>

<p>“No; I don’t think so; she laughed a good
deal, and said we were funny kiddies. She told
Mother she would be glad of the extra time, because
she wanted to study her music. She offered
to give us music lessons, but that was something
we wouldn’t stand. Arithmetic and history are
bad enough, but music! Oh, my goodness!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you love music?” inquired Gretel in
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Not much, at least not the kind Miss Heath
plays. I like the music at dancing-school pretty
well, but Mother’s crazy about Miss Heath’s kind.
She’s always getting her to play the piano in the
evenings, and Father listens, too, but he almost
always goes to sleep. Miss Heath wants to play
in concerts, and Mother’s going to try to get her
an engagement when we go back to New York.”</p>

<p>“My father played in concerts,” said Gretel,
eagerly. “He was a great musician, Hermann
Schiller—did you ever hear him play?”</p>

<p>Geraldine was forced to admit that she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
not, but added politely that perhaps Mother had,
and just then they reached the cottage Mr. Barlow
had taken for the season. Mr. and Mrs.
Barlow were on their way to call on some friends,
so the children went into the house alone.</p>

<p>“There’s Miss Heath playing now,” remarked
Geraldine, as they mounted the piazza steps, and
the sound of a distant piano fell upon their ears.
“She always plays when she’s by herself. I
don’t believe she really minded about our not
letting her go to the fort.”</p>

<p>“It was all your fault,” declared Jerry; “I was
perfectly willing to have her come along.”</p>

<p>Geraldine looked a little ashamed.</p>

<p>“Well, if we’d given in to her in one thing,
it might have made trouble afterwards,” she
maintained stoutly. “We said in that paper that
she wasn’t to come near us except at lessons, and
she agreed to it. Come up to my room, Gretel;
you can take off your things there.”</p>

<p>But greatly to Geraldine’s surprise, her new
friend had suddenly appeared to lose all interest
in her society. As the front door opened, and
the sound of the piano became more distinct, she
had given one little start, and was now standing
quite still, with clasped hands, and parted lips,
while her cheeks grew pink, and her eyes began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
to shine in a way that seemed to the twins quite
startling.</p>

<p>“It’s one of Father’s pieces,” she whispered
rapturously—“one he wrote himself, I mean.
Oh, how wonderful!” And then, as if forgetful
of everything else in the world, she darted forward,
and fairly flew across the hall to the parlor,
followed by her two wondering companions.</p>

<p>A young lady was seated at the piano; a very
pretty young lady, with dimples, and soft light
hair, that fell in little curls over her forehead.
At the entrance of the children, she paused in
her playing, and turned to greet them with a
smile. But before she could speak, or the twins
offer any explanation, Gretel had sprung to the
strange young lady’s side, and laid a trembling
little hand on her arm.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t stop, please don’t!” she cried imploringly;
“it’s Father’s sonata, and you were
playing it so beautifully. I love all Father’s
things so, and I haven’t heard any of them since—since—”
A big sob finished the sentence.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear little girl,” exclaimed Miss
Heath, her face changing from amusement to real
sympathy; “what is the matter—what does this
all mean, children?”</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>The twins shook their heads helplessly, and
stared at their visitor in blank amazement.</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything the matter,” faltered
Gretel, “only you were playing Father’s sonata,
and I was so glad to hear it. I couldn’t help
getting excited. Please excuse me; I didn’t mean
to interrupt.”</p>

<p>Barbara Heath’s only answer was to slip an
arm round the little trembling figure.</p>

<p>“Who is this little girl?” she inquired of the
twins.</p>

<p>“Her name is Gretel Schiller,” Geraldine explained.
“Father and Mother know her brother,
and she’s going to spend the day. We’re going
up-stairs now; come along, Gretel.”</p>

<p>But Gretel did not move.</p>

<p>“Gretel Schiller,” repeated Miss Heath.
“Why, can it be possible that your father was
Hermann Schiller?” And she glanced at the
sheet of music before her on the piano.</p>

<p>“Yes, he was,” said Gretel, proudly. “Oh,
would you mind finishing the sonata? I want to
hear it so very much.”</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” said Miss Heath, kindly.
“I am very fond of it myself, but I am afraid I
may not do it justice; it is rather difficult, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
I haven’t had much time for practicing lately.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you will,” protested Gretel. “You
were playing it just the way Father did. I
haven’t heard any one play the piano like that
since he died. May I stay here for a little while,
Geraldine? I want so much to hear the lady
play?”</p>

<p>“You can stay if you want to,” answered
Geraldine, who was beginning to look rather disgusted
at this sudden turn of affairs, “but she’s
Miss Heath, our teacher, and we don’t have to
stay with her except at lessons. Jerry and I are
going up-stairs, and you can come when you get
ready.” And Geraldine departed, followed by
her brother.</p>

<p>Then followed an hour of such bliss as Gretel
had not known since her father’s death more than
a year before. Miss Heath was really an accomplished
musician, and what was more, she
loved music just as much as Gretel did. It was
a real delight to play to any one who seemed to
enjoy it as did this odd little brown-eyed girl, who
nestled close to her side, and seemed to drink in
every note with actual rapture. She finished the
sonata, and after playing several other beautiful
things, she asked the child kind, interested questions,
all of which Gretel answered readily. Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
Heath knew all about Hermann Schiller, and had
even heard him play several times, and she caused
Gretel’s proud little heart to swell by her praises
of her father’s talent. Indeed, Gretel was completely
fascinated by the pretty young lady, and
it seemed to her quite inconceivable that Jerry
and Geraldine could regard Miss Heath as a
rather tiresome addition to the party, whose
society was to be dispensed with on every possible
occasion.</p>

<p>At last Miss Heath suggested that it might be
well for Gretel to rejoin her friends.</p>

<p>“I can’t join them myself,” she added, laughing,
“because I am under contract to appear only
at lesson hours. They are a funny little pair,
but I am sure you will like them.”</p>

<p>Gretel would have preferred remaining where
she was, but feared it might not be polite to leave
the twins for too long, so she rose reluctantly.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much for playing,” she said
in her sweet, courteous little voice; “I didn’t
know I should ever hear any one play the piano
like that again.”</p>

<p>“I will play for you as often as you like,”
promised Miss Heath, who was pleased as well
as touched by the simple compliment. “Do you
expect to be at Old Point long?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>Gretel said that she was staying at the hotel
with her brother, and that he was attending to
some business in the neighborhood. She was not
sure how long they would remain, but thought it
would be several weeks.</p>

<p>“Then you must come to see me often,” said
Miss Heath. “I haven’t very much to do, as
the children object to my society out of lesson
hours. Now come and I will show you the way
up-stairs; Jerry and Geraldine will think you have
forsaken them.”</p>

<p>Gretel found the twins deep in an animated
discussion; Geraldine perched on the foot of her
bed; Jerry standing in the middle of the floor,
his face very red, and both hands thrust deep into
his pockets.</p>

<p>“Here comes Gretel,” exclaimed Geraldine, as
the visitor entered the room; “shall we let her
settle it?”</p>

<p>“Not if she won’t settle it the right way,”
returned Jerry, firmly. “I say it’s mean not to
let her go.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” Gretel inquired, glancing from
one solemn little face to the other.</p>

<p>“It’s about this afternoon,” said Geraldine;
“Father has promised to take us to the navy yard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
at Newport News, and Jerry thinks we ought to
let Miss Heath go, too.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, of course you ought,” declared
Gretel, with so much decision that Jerry gave vent
to his satisfaction by an eager “Good for you,”
and favored his new friend with a friendly smile.</p>

<p>But Geraldine was not so easily convinced.</p>

<p>“It isn’t in the contract,” she objected; “the
contract says she is only to be with us at lessons,
and to-day is Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Bother the old contract!” retorted Jerry.
“I say it’s mean to leave her by herself all the
time, with nothing to do but read books and play
on the old piano. If she isn’t to go I won’t go
either; so there!”</p>

<p>Geraldine was troubled; she was very fond of
her twin, but a bargain was a bargain.</p>

<p>“I know how we’ll settle it,” she exclaimed,
with a sudden inspiration; “we’ll draw lots. I’ll
get two pieces of paper, a long one and a short
one, and you can draw. The long one means she
goes, the short one she doesn’t. But if she does
go she’s got to promise not to say a word about
history or any other teaching thing all the afternoon.”</p>

<p>Jerry consented to this arrangement, and Gretel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
looked on with considerable interest while the
papers were produced, and Miss Heath’s fate decided.
Geraldine held the two pieces of paper
in her hand, and her brother shut his eyes tight
before drawing. There was a moment of breathless
excitement, followed by a shout of triumph
from Jerry; he had drawn the long piece.</p>

<p>Jerry rushed off to tell Miss Heath the good
news that she was to be permitted to share their
society for the afternoon, and Geraldine showed
Gretel her dolls, and a few other treasures, which
she had brought from New York, over which the
two little girls soon became very good friends.
Then Mr. and Mrs. Barlow came home, and the
whole party went over to the hotel to luncheon.</p>

<p>The twins talked a great deal at the luncheon
table, and expressed their likes and dislikes on
so many subjects, that Gretel could not help
wondering why their parents did not reprove them
occasionally, but Mr. and Mrs. Barlow did not
appear to notice, and as for pretty Miss Heath,
she was so bright and merry, and laughed so
much at the children’s remarks, that Gretel could
not imagine why they should not find her a most
delightful companion. Every one was very kind
to the little visitor, and Mrs. Barlow asked her
to accompany the party to the navy yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“Miss Heath is going, too,” announced Jerry,
with his mouth full of ice-cream.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barlow looked a little surprised, but not
at all displeased.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am really to be permitted to join the
party,” said Miss Heath, laughing; “I believe
the question was settled by the drawing of lots.”</p>

<p>“But there’s a condition,” put in Geraldine,
gravely; “she isn’t to mention any teaching things
like history or geography all the afternoon.
She’s just to be an ordinary lady, not a teacher.”
At which remark Miss Heath laughed more than
ever, and Mr. and Mrs. Barlow also seemed much
amused.</p>

<p>So, shortly after luncheon the party, consisting
of Mr. Barlow, Miss Heath and the three children,
started for Newport News. Mrs. Barlow
had an engagement with friends at the hotel, but
before they started she kissed both twins, and
delivered quite a long lecture to them, on the
subject of improving their opportunities.</p>

<p>“This visit to the navy yard is a great privilege
for my little boy and girl,” she ended, “and I
shall expect them both to appreciate it, and to
remember all they see and hear. Mother will
want to be told all about it this evening.”</p>

<p>Jerry looked rather bored, and Geraldine fidgeted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
impatiently from one foot to the other, but
just then their father called them, and they were
off like a shot, without even taking the time to
answer.</p>

<p>“Your mother likes to hear about everything
you do, doesn’t she?” remarked Gretel a little
wistfully to Geraldine, as they were on their way
to the trolley car. “My father was like that,
too; I always told him about everything.”</p>

<p>“Mother doesn’t really care very much,” answered
Geraldine, indifferently; “she gets most
of those ideas out of books. She never used to
bother so much; it’s only since she’s been going
to those lectures. We like her much better this
way, though. She used to be always worrying
for fear we would take cold or eat something that
would disagree with us.”</p>

<p>Gretel enjoyed the afternoon immensely. The
ride in the car, which at times went almost as
fast as an automobile; the visit to the navy yard,
where they were allowed to go aboard a battle-ship;
and the pleasant society of her companions.
Before the excursion was over she had become
quite attached to Jerry and Geraldine, and
was sure Miss Heath must be one of the most
delightful young ladies in the world. The twins
were so fascinated with the battle-ship, that their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
father had some difficulty in tearing them away.</p>

<p>“I think to live on a boat must be the loveliest
thing in the world,” declared Geraldine, when
they were at last leaving the big ship.</p>

<p>“You will have a chance to try if we go abroad
next year,” her father told her. But Geraldine
did not look quite satisfied.</p>

<p>“Next year is such a long time off,” she objected,
“and perhaps we won’t even go then.”</p>

<p>“I’m going sometime, anyhow,” announced
Jerry in a tone of settled conviction, and then
the subject was dropped.</p>

<p>The car going back to Old Point was so
crowded that it was impossible for the whole
party to sit together. Mr. Barlow took the twins
out on the front platform, and Gretel, much to
her delight, found herself alone with Miss Heath.</p>

<p>“Do you think I have behaved myself well
enough to be invited again?” the young lady
asked, smiling, as the car started. “I haven’t
mentioned any ‘teaching things,’ have I?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed you haven’t,” returned Gretel,
laughing, “but I wish you would talk a little
about ‘teaching things’ to me—that is if you
like talking about them. You see, I’m dreadfully
behind with my lessons, and I haven’t had
any since January. My brother says he is going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
to send me to school next year, but he’s afraid
it’s a little late to begin this season.”</p>

<p>Miss Heath looked interested, and by dint of a
few kindly questions, had soon learned all Gretel’s
simple story.</p>

<p>“It has been so beautiful ever since my brother
came home, that I feel as if I must be living in
a fairy story,” finished the little girl, “but I’m
afraid if I don’t begin to learn something soon,
he may be ashamed of me. I’m even forgetting
my German.”</p>

<p>“I will speak German with you if you like,”
said Miss Heath. “I studied music for several
years in Germany, and used to speak the language
fairly well.” And she added a few words
in German, which caused Gretel’s eyes to sparkle
with delight.</p>

<p>“You speak it beautifully!” she cried joyfully.
“Oh, I am so glad. Nobody has spoken German
to me in such a long time, and I love it so, because
it was Father’s language. I wish my
brother spoke it, but he says he doesn’t know a
word.”</p>

<p>Miss Heath looked rather surprised, but seeing
the tears in Gretel’s eyes, she refrained from asking
any more questions.</p>

<p>“I, too, had a dear father, whom I loved very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
much,” she said. “He only left me last year,
and I have missed him terribly.”</p>

<p>Gretel glanced at her new friend’s black dress,
and instinctively nestled a little closer to her.</p>

<p>“You know all about it, then,” she said, softly.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, I know all about it.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t been so lonely since my brother
came home,” said Gretel. “I hope you have a
brother, too; brothers are so nice. I never knew
how nice mine was till he came back from China.”</p>

<p>“China!” repeated Miss Heath in surprise;
“did your brother go to China? I have been
there, too. My father was a great traveler, and
he and I have been nearly all over the world together.
It was on our voyage home from China
that he was taken ill. He died in San Francisco,
and I have been alone ever since, for I am not
so fortunate as you. I was an only child, and
my mother died when I was a little girl.”</p>

<p>Miss Heath smiled bravely, but her eyes looked
sad, and her lip trembled a little. With a sudden
loving impulse, Gretel slipped her hand into that
of her new friend.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry,” she whispered; “I wish you
had a brother.” That was all, but Miss Heath
squeezed the kind little hand tight, and Gretel
felt sure that she understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>They were on their way from the car to the
hotel when Gretel caught sight of her brother,
standing on the sidewalk just in front of them,
in conversation with another gentleman.</p>

<p>“There’s Percy!” she exclaimed eagerly to
Miss Heath, for she still lingered by her new
friend’s side, although the twins had run on ahead,
and Mr. Barlow stopped to do an errand.</p>

<p>“Where, dear?” Miss Heath asked, for she
was beginning to feel some curiosity in this big
brother, of whom her little friend seemed so
proud.</p>

<p>“There, that tall gentleman, talking to the old
man in spectacles. That’s my brother; don’t you
think he’s handsome?”</p>

<p>But Miss Heath did not answer. She had
come to a sudden standstill, and her cheeks had
grown very pink. Just then Mr. Douane caught
sight of Gretel and her companion, and he too
stopped short in evident astonishment.</p>

<p>“Barbara—I beg your pardon,—Miss
Heath! Is it possible?”</p>

<p>Gretel’s eyes opened wide in amazement, and
well they might, for there was her tall brother
holding Miss Heath’s hand, and gazing down
at her with such a strange, glad look in his eyes,
and there was Miss Heath actually trembling a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
little, as she declared that she had never been
so surprised in her life.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t the least idea you were in this
country,” Gretel heard her say, and her voice did
not sound quite steady, although she was smiling
and looking prettier than ever.</p>

<p>“And you,” said Mr. Douane, “I had no idea
where you were. I tried to find you, but you
had left no address at the hotel in Hong-Kong.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Father must have forgotten to leave
any,” said Miss Heath. “He was not well, and
decided to leave rather suddenly.”</p>

<p>For the first few moments neither Mr. Douane
nor Miss Heath appeared to remember Gretel’s
existence, but when Miss Heath explained that
she had come to Old Point with a Mr. and Mrs.
Barlow, and Mr. Douane explained in his turn
that he and his little sister were staying at the
“Chamberlain,” he suddenly remembered Gretel,
and turned to look for her. And then everybody
was surprised all over again.</p>

<p>“I had no idea the brother my little friend
Gretel has been telling me so much about would
turn out to be a friend of mine as well,” said
Miss Heath, “but I don’t think I quite understand
the situation even yet. She tells me her
name is Schiller.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“My mother’s second husband was Hermann
Schiller, the pianist,” said Mr. Douane; “Gretel
is their little girl. We never knew each other
till about ten days ago, but we are great chums
now.” And he slipped an arm affectionately
round his little sister.</p>

<p>“Oh, Percy,” exclaimed Gretel, the moment
she and her brother were alone together, having
left Miss Heath at the Barlows’ cottage, “isn’t
she the dearest, loveliest young lady you ever
saw, and aren’t you glad you’ve found her again?
I heard you tell her you’d been trying to find
her.”</p>

<p>“I am indeed,” answered Mr. Douane, heartily.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE LAW OF LOVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE ten days that followed were about the
happiest Gretel had ever spent in her
life. There were so many interesting
and delightful things to do, and each day as it
passed seemed pleasanter than the one before.
Somewhat to the surprise of their parents, Jerry
and Geraldine—who had very decided likes and
dislikes—had taken a great fancy to Gretel, and
the three children were constantly together. Mr. and
Mrs. Barlow were glad to encourage the intimacy,
and Gretel was included in all the pleasures
of the twins. But much as she liked the
companionship of her two merry little friends,
there was another person in the Barlows’ cottage
for whose society she cared a great deal more,
and that was Miss Heath, the pretty young
teacher. True to her promise, Miss Heath was
always ready to play, or to speak German; and to
hear music and talk in her dear father’s language
were the two greatest pleasures of Gretel’s life.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
She was growing to love Miss Heath very dearly,
and the young lady, touched at first by Gretel’s
evident admiration for her playing, soon grew to
return the little girl’s affection.</p>

<p>Perhaps Gretel did not enjoy quite as much
of her brother’s society as in the first week of
their stay at Old Point, but she did not mind, for
when not with her was he not sure to be either
walking or driving with her dear Miss Heath?
Gretel was an unselfish little soul, and she rejoiced
heartily in the knowledge that her new
friend was having a good time as well as herself.</p>

<p>So the bright spring days came and went, and
Gretel was very happy. If it had not been for
one thing—one painful memory—she would
not have had a care in the world; but try as she
would to forget it, that one uncomfortable recollection
would persist in haunting even her
happiest moments. Sometimes after she had
gone to bed at night, she would bury her face in
the pillow, and wonder miserably what Miss Heath
would think if she were ever to learn that
her little friend had once stolen a ticket to fairy-land.
Yes, that was what she had done; the
more she thought about it the more certain she
became. She had known perfectly well that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
was her duty to return that ticket to the box
office, and yet she had willfully kept it, and used
it herself.</p>

<p>“If I only knew the person who lost it were
rich, and didn’t mind very much,” she said to
herself over and over again, “it wouldn’t be quite
so dreadful, but it may have belonged to somebody
who was poor, and who loved music just
as much as I do.” And then she would try to
imagine how she would have felt if she had
bought a ticket to fairy-land and lost it.</p>

<p>“I’m quite sure I could never have forgiven
the person who used it,” she told herself with
conviction.</p>

<p>It was a cold, rainy afternoon in early April,
and Gretel and Miss Heath were alone in the
Barlows’ parlor, enjoying an hour of music. Mr. and
Mrs. Barlow had lingered at the hotel after
luncheon, and the twins were up-stairs.</p>

<p>For the first time that day, Miss Heath had
succeeded in persuading Gretel to play for her,
and she was much impressed by the child’s evident
talent.</p>

<p>“You play very well indeed, Gretel,” she said.
“Your brother must let you have lessons from
a good teacher. Of course you are out of practice,
but you’ll soon pick up what you have lost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>Gretel’s eyes shone with delight.</p>

<p>“Do you really think I ought to ask Percy to
give me anything more?” she asked a little doubtfully.
“It costs a great deal of money to take
music lessons, you know.”</p>

<p>Miss Heath laughed.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you need hesitate,” she said;
“I am sure Mr. Douane will be glad to encourage
your talent, and as for the expense, I wouldn’t
worry about that if I were you.”</p>

<p>Gretel looked much relieved.</p>

<p>“I’m very glad you think so,” she said.
“Sometimes I can’t help worrying a little for
fear Percy may be spending too much money.
Father was so extravagant, and I’m not used to
having so many things.”</p>

<p>“You dear kiddy,” laughed Miss Heath, kissing
her; “if you were my little sister I think I
should want to give you everything you wanted
in the world.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Gretel, returning her friend’s kiss
with effusion, “how I wish you were my sister!”
At which remark Miss Heath laughed again, and
grew so very pink that Gretel regarded her in
some surprise.</p>

<p>“I think to take music lessons would make me
happier than anything else in the world,” she said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
after a little pause. “I used to dream about
having them when I was at Mrs. Marsh’s, but
I never thought my dream would come true. Oh,
Miss Heath dear, did you ever want to hear music
so much that it made you ache all over?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I have,” answered Miss Heath, with
ready sympathy; “I have felt like that more than
once during this past year, since my dear father
left me, and I have been alone in the world. I
know just what you mean, Gretel. There have
been days when I have felt that I could spend
my last penny for a ticket to the opera.”</p>

<p>Gretel gave a little start, and caught her friend’s
hand eagerly, but before she could speak, a figure
passed in front of the window, and Miss Heath
rose hastily, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Here comes Mr. Douane; run and open the
door for him, Gretel.”</p>

<p>Mr. Douane had come to take Miss Heath to
a concert, which was to be given that afternoon
by the Hampton colored students; Gretel had a
momentary hope that she might be included in
the party, but nothing was said on the subject,
and she had already noticed that Percy seemed
to like to keep Miss Heath to himself.</p>

<p>“The storm is getting worse,” Mr. Douane
remarked, warming his hands at the fire, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
Miss Heath went away to put on her things. “I
am sorry for the people going by the boat to-night;
the wind is rising, and I think we are in
for a stiff gale.”</p>

<p>Gretel went and stood beside her brother on
the rug, and he put his arm round her, and looked
down very kindly into her flushed, happy little
face. She was hoping that Miss Heath might
mention the music lessons to him that afternoon,
but did not quite dare broach the subject herself.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do this afternoon,
Pussy?” Mr. Douane asked.</p>

<p>“She is going to stay with the twins and keep
them out of mischief,” said Miss Heath, returning
at that moment, in hat and waterproof.
“Mr. and Mrs. Barlow are going to a tea at the
colonel’s house, and the children are to be left to
themselves. Mrs. Barlow appears to have perfect
confidence in them, but I confess I don’t feel
quite so sure of their keeping out of mischief.
I always feel quite safe, however, when Gretel
is with them, for she has a level little head on
her shoulders.”</p>

<p>Gretel watched her brother and Miss Heath
from the window until they were out of sight,
and then went up-stairs in quest of Jerry and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
Geraldine. She found them sitting on the sofa
in the temporary nursery, and, somewhat to her
surprise, neither of their faces brightened at
sight of their friend and comrade.</p>

<p>“We thought you’d gone home,” remarked
Geraldine; “you didn’t tell us you were going to
stay.”</p>

<p>Gretel was a little offended, but she remembered
that the twins were only ten, and tried to
make allowances.</p>

<p>“I did mean to go home,” she explained pleasantly,
“but Miss Heath asked me to stay. She’s
gone to a concert at Hampton with Percy, and
your father and mother are going to a tea. It’s
raining too hard to go out, so I thought we might
play something in the house, or else read aloud.
I’d love to read some more about ‘Dave Porter.’”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry, but I’m afraid you can’t
stay,” said Geraldine, with decision. “We don’t
want any company this afternoon, do we, Jerry?”</p>

<p>Jerry reddened, and looked very uncomfortable.
As a rule, he was more polite than his sister, and
he was, moreover, very fond of Gretel.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we tell her about it?” he suggested
rather timidly.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” returned Geraldine, indignantly.
“You really are a dreadful silly, Jerry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
Gretel’s all right, and we like her, but she can’t
expect to be in all our secrets. Miss Heath is all
right, too, but we don’t want her around except
at lessons. She understands, and doesn’t get mad
about it.”</p>

<p>“I’m not mad,” protested Gretel, reddening;
“I don’t want to stay if you don’t want me. I’ll
go home and read; I’ve got a very interesting
book that Percy bought for me this morning.”
And Gretel turned away, and ran quickly down-stairs,
not wishing to let the twins see how really
hurt she was.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have minded if they had asked
me nicely to go home,” she said to herself, as she
hurried back to the hotel through the wind and
rain. “Geraldine is terribly rude sometimes.
I think Mrs. Barlow might teach her children to
be a little more polite.”</p>

<p>She found Higgins sewing by the window in
her room. At the entrance of the little girl, the
maid looked up with a smile.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’ve come ’ome,” she said; “it’s
a hawful hafternoon, and the storm’s getting
worse hevery minute.”</p>

<p>Gretel came over to the window, and looked
out. The usually quiet bay seemed transformed
into a seething turmoil of waves and foam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“The Baltimore boat is getting up steam,” she
remarked with interest; “I don’t suppose many
people will go on her to-night.”</p>

<p>“Well, I pity them that does,” returned Higgins,
solemnly; “I’ve been in a storm at sea, and
know the danger.”</p>

<p>“Were you shipwrecked?” inquired Gretel,
eagerly. “The twins have been reading a most
exciting book about a shipwreck.”</p>

<p>“No, we wasn’t, but we hexpected to be hevery
minute,” answered Higgins. “It was a hexperience
folks don’t forget when they’ve once ’ad it.
Where’s Mr. Douane this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Gone to Hampton to a concert with Miss Heath.
Miss Heath asked me to stay with Jerry
and Geraldine, but they don’t want me. They
told me to go home.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! but what can one hexpect from children
brought up as they are, let run wild from
morning till night. ’Ow a sweet young lady like
that Miss ’Eath can put up with them beats me,
but it won’t be for long, I’m thinking; there’s
something in the wind.”</p>

<p>“What’s in the wind?” Gretel asked, as a
severer gust than usual rattled the windows.</p>

<p>“Never you mind; it ain’t a subject as young
ladies of your age should talk about. I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
what’s proper for young ladies, ’aving lived in
the best families of the Henglish haristocracy.
When I was at Sir Cecil Marlow’s—where I
lived two years before going to Lord Carresford’s—’er
ladyship was very particular that Miss Sylvia
and Miss Muriel should never ’ear anything
in the way of gossip, and quite right she
was, too. The knowingness of these Hamerican
children is enough to make your blood run cold
sometimes. There never was two sweeter or better
brought up young ladies that Miss Sylvia and
Miss Muriel.” And Higgins launched forth into
a long story about these two paragons of the
British aristocracy, which was so interesting that
Gretel forgot to wonder what was “in the wind,”
and why she was not to know about it.</p>

<p>Higgins now proved a most interesting companion.
It is always interesting to hear about
people who live in castles, with parks and hunting-lodges
thrown in, and in listening to the English
woman’s stories, the afternoon slipped away
very pleasantly. By and by, however, Higgins
went down-stairs to her tea, and then Gretel noticed
for the first time how the wind was howling,
and the rain dashing against the window
panes.</p>

<p>“The storm is getting worse, just as Percy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
thought it would,” she said to herself, with a
comfortable feeling of satisfaction at being safely
indoors; “I’m glad nobody I know is going on
the boat to-night.”</p>

<p>She went to the window, and stood looking
out at the wild landscape of sea and rain. The
pier was almost deserted, but the Baltimore night
boat was evidently preparing to start on her
journey. A few passengers, chiefly men, were
going on board, but there was none of the usual
crowd and bustle of departure, which Gretel had
enjoyed watching on other evenings, for the windows
of her room commanded a fine view of the
pier, and all the arriving and departing steamers.
She thought of what Higgins had said about ship-wrecks,
and gave a little involuntary shiver.</p>

<p>Just then her attention was caught by something
so astonishing that she uttered a little cry
of dismay, and, regardless of wind and rain,
hastily threw up the window, and leaned out.
Along the pier, battling against the storm, came
two resolute little figures; a small boy and a small
girl. They had no umbrella, but were evidently
dressed for rainy weather, and the boy was carrying
a brown paper parcel under his arm.</p>

<p>“Jerry—Geraldine!” shrieked Gretel, leaning
as far out of the window as she could, and shouting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
at the top of her voice; “where are you going?
Come back; come right back this minute.”</p>

<p>But the noise of the wind drowned Gretel’s
voice, and at that moment she saw her two little
friends calmly cross the gang-plank, and disappear
from view on board the Baltimore
steamer.</p>

<p>So that was the secret; that was why the twins
had sent her home! They had deliberately
planned to run away, and take this trip on the
boat. She remembered several mysterious hints,
which had passed unheeded at the time. The
twins had been planning an adventure. But they
must be stopped; they must be brought back before
the boat started. Gretel did not know just
what time it was, but she knew that the boat left
at five, and felt sure it could not be far from that
hour. If it had been a clear night she would
not have been so much frightened, knowing that
Jerry and Geraldine were capable of taking care
of themselves under most circumstances, but in
this dreadful storm—oh, she must do something;
she must stop them before it was too late.</p>

<p>Hastily snatching her waterproof from the
wardrobe, Gretel opened the door, and, without
even waiting to close the window, ran at full
speed down the long corridor to the stairs. Most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
of the hotel guests were in their rooms at that
hour, and the few people she met did not appear
to pay much attention to the child, as she flew
down-stairs, across the covered piazza, and out
onto the pier. A gust of wind nearly took her
off her feet, and the sudden dash of rain in her
face took away her breath, but she pushed resolutely
on. Had not Miss Heath said she always
felt the twins were safe when she was with them?
Surely, oh, surely, she would be able to persuade
them to give up their adventure, and go back
before the boat started.</p>

<p>It was so slippery crossing the gang-plank that
Gretel almost fell, but a strong hand caught her,
and a good-natured voice remarked—</p>

<p>“You’re in a mighty hurry, Missie; the boat
don’t start for five minutes yet.”</p>

<p>“Five minutes!” panted Gretel; “oh, I must
hurry.” And before the astonished steward
could ask any questions, she had fled up the stairs
to the saloon.</p>

<p>But where were the twins? That was the
question. They were nowhere to be seen in the
saloon, and Gretel’s heart sank. Suppose she
failed to find them before those five precious
minutes were up; what should she do? She
never thought of her own danger of being carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
off; her one desire was to rescue her two
little friends before it was too late. There were
very few passengers on board that day, for many
who had intended taking the trip had changed
their plans on account of the storm. The saloon
was practically deserted, and Gretel met no one
as she hurried along, calling eagerly, “Jerry,
Geraldine; oh, children, where are you?”</p>

<p>But this time her voice was not drowned by
the gale, and suddenly the door of one of the
staterooms was opened a very little way, and a
laughing, mischievous face peeped out.</p>

<p>With a bound Gretel reached the door; pushed
it farther open, and forced her way in.</p>

<p>“Come back,” she cried authoritatively;
“come back this minute; the boat’s going to start.
Oh, how could you do such a dreadful thing?”</p>

<p>But Jerry and Geraldine did not come back;
on the contrary, they retreated to the furthest
corner of the stateroom.</p>

<p>“We’re going to Baltimore,” announced
Jerry; “we’re stowaways. Come in and shut
the door.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how can you be so silly?” cried Gretel,
actually stamping her foot in her impatience;
“you know perfectly well you can’t go off to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
Baltimore by yourselves. Besides, it’s an awful
storm; the boat may be wrecked.”</p>

<p>But if Gretel hoped to frighten the twins by
this dreadful possibility, she was much mistaken.</p>

<p>“Shipwrecked!” cried Jerry, with a little skip
of delight; “oh, goody, that would be the best
of all! Come in and shut the door; if anybody
sees us we can’t be stowaways.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t be stowaways, you know you
can’t. I never heard of anything so ridiculous.
Oh, children, do come quick; there’s the whistle.”</p>

<p>“But we don’t intend to come back,” said Geraldine,
tranquilly. She had seated herself on the
lower berth, and taken off her hat and raincoat.
“Don’t you understand we’re doing it on purpose?
We’ve brought some supper with us in a
parcel, and we’re going to have a wonderful time.
We told you we were going on the boat some
time.”</p>

<p>“But think how frightened everybody will
be,” urged Gretel, trying a new tack. “You
don’t want to frighten your mother and Miss Heath,
and—and every one, do you? They
won’t have any idea where you are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they will,” Geraldine reassured her;
“we left a letter telling them all about it. Jerry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
wrote it, but I made it up. It was such a lovely
letter; just like one in a book we read, that a
boy wrote his mother when he was running away
to sea. Mother says we’ve got to learn things
by experience, and how can we learn about boats
unless we go on one? They made us come all
the way from New York in a horrid train, and
we’ve got to go home that way, too, because
Mother doesn’t like boats. So if we don’t go
by ourselves we shall never know what boats are
like. We’re going to be stowaways, and stay in
here for quite a long time, and then we shall let
ourselves be discovered, and everybody will be
so interested, the way they are in stories.
They’ll give us lots of good things to eat, and
make up a purse for us, but we’re so clean they
won’t need to give us a bath.”</p>

<p>Gretel clasped her hands in despair.</p>

<p>“But think how seasick you’ll be,” she hazarded
as a last resource, “and how you’ll be punished
when you get home.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” sniffed Geraldine, contemptuously;
“we’re Mind Cures; Mind Cures never get seasick.
It’s only sillies like you that bother about
such things.”</p>

<p>“We shan’t be punished either,” chimed in
Jerry; “we’re never punished now, not since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
Mother began bringing us up by the Law of Love.
She’ll only talk to us, and we don’t mind that
much. Besides, she said we had to learn things
by experience. There’s somebody coming; I’ve
got to shut the door.”</p>

<p>And before the horrified Gretel could interpose,
or even utter another word of protest, Jerry
had closed the door, locked it, and put the key in
his pocket. And at that very moment the second
whistle sounded, and the steamer began to
move.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">GRETEL sank down upon the bed beside
Geraldine, and began to cry.</p>

<p>“The boat’s going,” she sobbed; “we
can’t get off now. We’ve got to go all the way
to Baltimore, and it’s such a dreadful storm.
Oh, it’s awful! It’s awful!” And poor little
Gretel lifted up her voice and wailed.</p>

<p>Now, neither of the twins liked to see people
cry. Mischievous and troublesome as they frequently
were, their hearts were anything but
hard, and at sight of their friend’s tears they
both began to look rather ashamed of themselves.</p>

<p>“Do stop being such a silly,” said Geraldine,
crossly, but she slipped an arm round Gretel’s
waist as she spoke, and tried to draw her hands
down from her face.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what you came for if you’re such
a scare-cat,” remarked Jerry in his gruffest tones.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
“We came for an adventure, and you’re going
to spoil it; I think you’re real mean.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t come on purpose,” protested Gretel
between her sobs; “I only came to bring you
home. I didn’t know the boat would go so soon.
Oh, I wish I hadn’t come. I don’t want to be
shipwrecked and drowned just now when Percy
has come home, and everything is so lovely.”</p>

<p>Now, oddly enough, the prospect of being shipwrecked,
which had struck the twins as so alluring
only a few minutes earlier, had suddenly lost
its charm, and both little faces began to look very
grave.</p>

<p>“We’re not really going to be shipwrecked,”
said Geraldine, uneasily; “we only said so for
fun. We’re not a bit afraid, and we’re going
to have a wonderful time. You’ll have a good
time too if you’ll only stop crying and making
such a fuss. We don’t mind your coming with
us, do we, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Of course we don’t,” said Jerry; “I wanted
to tell her about it all the time, but you said we
mustn’t.”</p>

<p>“That was because I was afraid she’d tell,”
explained Geraldine; “but now you’re here, Gretel,
and can’t go back, I don’t see why you won’t
have a good time. The boat won’t stop again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
till we get to Baltimore to-morrow morning; we
found that out before we started.”</p>

<p>But Gretel did not feel in the least like having
a good time.</p>

<p>“Have you brought any money?” she inquired
mournfully.</p>

<p>The twins shook their heads.</p>

<p>“Then how do you expect to get home
again?” demanded Gretel, with a fresh burst of
tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, the passengers who make up the purse
for us will send us home; they always do,” Jerry
assured her cheerfully. “Stowaways never take
any money with them. There was a little boy
stowaway on the same ship with our uncle, and
the passengers got up a concert for him, and
gave him ’most a hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t bring any other things either,”
added Geraldine, “not even a tooth-brush.
Jerry thought it would be more of an adventure
to go to bed without brushing our teeth, and
with all our clothes on. Then of course we
won’t have to take a bath in the morning. You
haven’t got any night things either, have you?”</p>

<p>“Of course I haven’t—how could I have?
I was just looking out of the window at the
storm, and I saw you getting on the boat. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
knew you were going to do something dreadful,
so I ran after you just as fast as I could. Nobody
knows where I am. Oh, what will Percy
and Higgins think!”</p>

<p>“Oh, do stop howling,” exclaimed Jerry, at
the end of his patience; “we’ll tell them it wasn’t
your fault, and I don’t believe you’ll be punished.”</p>

<p>“Does your brother often punish you?”
Geraldine asked a little anxiously.</p>

<p>“He never has punished me, but I haven’t
known him long. It isn’t the being punished
that I mind; it’s—it’s—oh, everything!” and
Gretel broke down once more and wailed.</p>

<p>But there was no use in crying over what could
not be helped, and in a little while Gretel dried
her eyes, and began to wonder what was going
to happen next. The twins would not hear of
her first suggestion that they should come out of
their hiding-place at once, and Jerry positively
refused to produce the key of the locked door.</p>

<p>“We came to be stowaways,” he maintained
stubbornly, “and stowaways never come out for
a long time.”</p>

<p>On almost any other day they would probably
have been discovered within a very short time,
as the stateroom would have been claimed, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
owing to the severity of the storm, very few of
the cabins were occupied, and so it was more
than half an hour before the stewardess bethought
herself to knock gently at the door, to
inquire if the inmate of number fifty-two wanted
anything. In the meantime the twins, who, having
come out for a good time, were determined
to have one, had opened their parcel, and spread
out the refreshments, which consisted of cake,
bananas, and chocolate.</p>

<p>“We bought them this morning when we were
out with Miss Heath,” Geraldine told Gretel.
“She didn’t know what we wanted them for,
but Jerry said we were going to have a feast,
and she knows she isn’t to interfere if it isn’t
lesson time. Then we met your brother, and he
talked to Miss Heath, and I guess she forgot all
about us. It’s pretty early for supper, but I
think we may as well begin, don’t you, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Ye—es,” said Jerry, eying the array of
good things rather dubiously; “I’m not very
hungry yet, though; suppose we wait a little
longer. I wonder what makes the boat swing
so much.”</p>

<p>“It’s because it’s getting rough,” said Gretel.
“I was on a boat once with Father when it was
very rough. We went down to Pleasure Bay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
on an excursion, and before we got back a storm
came up, and the boat rocked dreadfully. Some
of the people on board were seasick, but Father
and I liked it.”</p>

<p>At that moment the steamer gave a sudden
plunge, which sent the children nearly off their
feet. Geraldine put down the piece of chocolate
she had just begun to eat, and turned rather
pale.</p>

<p>“I guess we will wait a little while longer,”
she agreed. “Don’t you think it’s rather hot in
here? Let’s open the window.”</p>

<p>But the opening of the window proved a more
difficult task than the children had expected, and
while Jerry and Gretel were still struggling with
a refractory fastening, Geraldine suddenly rolled
over in a little heap on the bed, in the midst of
the refreshments.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” demanded Jerry, looking
a little frightened.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” faltered Geraldine, with
white lips; “I feel very queer; I think I’m ill.”</p>

<p>“You’re seasick,” announced Gretel, who knew
the signs; “I guess we’ll have to call somebody.
We can’t open the window, and you won’t feel
any better till you get some fresh air.”</p>

<p>It was at that moment that there came a tap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
at the stateroom door, and Jerry, no longer refusing
to produce the key, promptly unlocked
it, and admitted a colored stewardess who at
sight of the three children, and the feast, threw
up her hands, with an exclamation of dismay.
But when she learned that the children were
traveling alone, and had come on board without
any luggage, her astonishment and horror were
almost beyond the power of words to express.
She kept repeating “fo’ de land’s sake!” over
and over again, and finally departed to tell the
news to the head steward, and as many of the
passengers as cared to listen. By the time she
returned, accompanied by the purser and two
stewards, poor little Geraldine was really in a
very bad way indeed.</p>

<p>“And no wonder,” remarked the purser, with
a grin; “we haven’t had a night like this in
months. I’m afraid you’re in for it, little miss.
And how are you feeling?” he added, turning
to the other two.</p>

<p>“I’m—I’m all right I guess,” said Jerry, trying
to smile, though the effort was rather a failure;
“we won’t really be sick, you see, because
we’re Mind Cures. Mind Cures never have anything
the matter with them. We’ve only got
to—” But at that moment the steamer gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
a tremendous roll, and Jerry never finished his
sentence.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, two very limp little figures,
with very white faces, were stretched on the
berths in number fifty-two, from which the
stewardess had charitably removed the “feast.”
Both twins were very sick—much too sick to
care about feasts, adventures, or anything else.</p>

<p>“I want Mother, oh, I want Mother!” wailed
Geraldine, between paroxysms of seasickness;
“she always takes care of us when we are ill.
Oh, I wish we hadn’t come; I do, I do!”</p>

<p>“I think I’m going to die,” announced Jerry,
and his gruff little voice was very shaky.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you’re not,” Gretel reassured him.
She was not at all sick herself, but was helping
the stewardess minister to her friends. “You
are only seasick, and people never die from seasickness.”</p>

<p>“I think I’d just as soon die as feel this way,”
groaned Jerry, at which the stewardess laughed
in a way which seemed to the children quite
brutal.</p>

<p>But she was not by any means a brutal or
heartless person, and was really as kind as possible
to the two little sufferers. She tried to persuade
Gretel to go down to the dining-saloon to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
have something to eat, but although not sick,
Gretel had no desire for food just then, and much
preferred remaining where she was.</p>

<p>As the evening advanced the storm seemed to
grow worse, instead of decreasing, as the passengers
had hoped it might when leaving Old
Point, and the little steamer rolled and pitched
in a manner calculated to disturb even the best
sailors.</p>

<p>“Do you think we are going to be shipwrecked?”
Gretel whispered anxiously to the
stewardess. The twins were beyond caring
whether they were wrecked or not.</p>

<p>“Shipwrecked!” repeated the colored woman,
scornfully; “no, indeed. Don’t you be scared,
Missie; dis yere boat’s all right. We’ll bring you
safe into Baltimore to-morrow mornin’, sure as
Fate.”</p>

<p>But though the stewardess spoke so confidently,
there were some people on board who were not
quite so sanguine, and when Gretel went out into
the saloon for a little air, she found several of
the lady passengers in tears.</p>

<p>“It’s the most terrible experience I’ve ever
had in my life,” declared one hysterical woman.
“They had no right to start the boat in such
a gale.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“If we ever see Baltimore I shall be very
much surprised,” wailed another. “Oh, why
did I ever leave my husband and children!”</p>

<p>Gretel did not repeat these remarks to her
companions when she went back to the stateroom,
but her heart was anything but light, and
she was growing more frightened every moment.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock the stewardess looked in for
the last time before going to bed. The twins
were a little better, and had both fallen asleep.</p>

<p>“Dey’ll be all right now, I guess,” she told
Gretel. “You’d better go to sleep too. Dere
ain’t any more beds in here, but I can put you in
another room. Dere’s plenty of empty ones dis
trip.”</p>

<p>But Gretel would not leave her friends, and
preferred curling up on the sofa, where she lay,
with wide-open eyes, listening to the strange
sounds of creaking and groaning, all quite
familiar to people accustomed to life on shipboard,
but which seemed to her very “frightening”
indeed. She was sure they were going to
be shipwrecked; they would all be drowned, and
she would never see Percy or Miss Heath again.
She wondered if Percy would be very sorry, and
what Miss Heath would say. They had neither
of them known her very long, and of course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
could not be expected to care as Mr. and Mrs.
Barlow would care if the twins were drowned,
but they had seemed to be rather fond of her,
and, oh, how good and kind they both were.
There was no use in trying to be brave or cheerful
any longer, and poor little Gretel let her feelings
have their way, and sobbed into the sofa
cushion.</p>

<p>She cried herself to sleep, and had just fallen
into a comfortable doze, when the steamer gave
a terrific roll, which sent her off the sofa. Geraldine
awoke with a shriek of terror as she struck
the floor.</p>

<p>For a moment it really seemed as if something
frightful had happened, and the children
clung to each other in helpless terror, but then
the steamer righted herself once more, and everything
seemed quiet.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so frightened—I’m so frightened!”
sobbed Geraldine, even seasickness forgotten in
this new alarm. “Gretel, do you think we’re
going to be drowned?”</p>

<p>“I guess it would serve us right if we were,”
observed a hoarse little voice from the upper
berth. “It was a pretty awful thing to do, to
run away by ourselves, and frighten Mother.”</p>

<p>“Mother said we must learn things by experience,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
said Geraldine, with chattering teeth, “and
I guess we are doing it, all right. It’s much
worse than being punished. I’d rather be
whipped every day, and not have any candy for
a month, than be seasick.”</p>

<p>“Shut up about candy,” commanded Jerry,
“I don’t ever want to see any candy again, or
cake, or bananas either. I don’t want ever to
eat anything, even meat or vegetables. I say,
Geraldine, do you suppose Mother’s awfully
frightened about us?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid she is,” said Geraldine, mournfully;
“she gets scared pretty quickly, even if
she is a Mind Cure. I hope she won’t be ill, like
she was the time she thought Father had been in
a railroad accident. She’ll feel dreadfully if
we’re drowned.”</p>

<p>“You won’t be drowned,” her brother assured
her; “they always put the women in the life
boats first. I may be, because of course I shan’t
go till all the women and children are saved.
Boys never do, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jerry, you are a brave boy!” exclaimed
Geraldine, admiringly, “but I wish you wouldn’t
talk about it; it scares me so.”</p>

<p>But Jerry seemed to rather enjoy the subject.</p>

<p>“If I am drowned, you’ll tell Father and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
Mother how brave I was, won’t you?” he said.
“Father can have my Waterbury watch, and
Mother can keep my seal ring if she wants it.
It’s too small for her to wear, but she might like
to have it to remember me by. I guess I’ll let
you have my magic lantern and the Punch and
Judy show, Geraldine, but you must be very careful
of them, because, you know, I might not be
dead, after all. I might be rescued, and carried
off on a ship, and sold for a slave, like the boy
in that book we read, and when I come back of
course I’d want my things, and—” Here another
big wave sent the steamer over on her side
again, and brought Jerry’s remarks to a sudden
conclusion. Geraldine screamed, and clutched
Gretel tight.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be drowned—I don’t want
to be drowned!” she wailed. “We’ve been
dreadfully naughty, and perhaps God won’t let
us go to Heaven.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’m sure He will,” soothed Gretel.
“Let’s say our prayers. We haven’t said them
to-night. I’m sure God will take care of us if
we ask Him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s say our prayers,” agreed Geraldine,
eagerly. “I was so sick I forgot all about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
saying them before, but I’ll do it now. You say
yours too, Jerry; we’ll all say them together.”</p>

<p>So the three children folded their hands, reverently,
and repeated the evening prayer they
all knew:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me,</div>
<div class="indent">Bless thy little lamb to-night;</div>
<div class="verse">Through the darkness be Thou near me;</div>
<div class="indent">Keep me safe till morning light.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>And after that although the storm continued,
and the little steamer pitched and plunged as much
as ever, things did not seem quite so terrible as
they had before. Gretel seemed so certain that
God would take care of them, and somehow the
twins had come to have a great deal of faith in
Gretel.</p>

<p>“God always takes care of people when they
ask Him to,” said Gretel, confidently. “Father
asked Him to take care of me when he was ill,
and He did. First Mrs. Marsh let me go and
live with her, and afterwards Percy came home.
Father said I must always ask God to take care
of me every day.”</p>

<p>“I hope He’ll take care of Mother, too, and
not let her be ill because she’s so frightened about
us,” said Geraldine, tremulously. “How do you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
suppose we are ever going to get home, Jerry?
We haven’t any money, and nobody has said anything
about making up a purse for us.”</p>

<p>Jerry had no suggestion to offer, but Gretel,
who was nearly two years older than the twins,
and had had a good deal more experience, said
she was quite sure they would be taken care of.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they’ll let us stay on the boat till it
goes back to-morrow night,” she suggested, but
Jerry and Geraldine did not take at all kindly
to that idea, and Jerry protested loudly that he
would rather walk all the way back to Old Point
than spend another night on that dreadful boat.
The very thought caused Geraldine a return of
seasickness, and she was most unhappy for the
next hour.</p>

<p>It was really a terrible night, and our three
little friends were not the only people on board
who lay awake and trembled, but towards morning
the wind began to go down, and the sea grew
calmer. By four o’clock they were in comparatively
quiet water, and Gretel as well as the twins
had fallen fast asleep.</p>

<p>They were still sleeping when the stewardess
accompanied by the head steward, came to have
a look at them, but at the sound of voices, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
the sudden flood of light caused by the opening
door, Jerry sat up and rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>“Good morning, young gentleman,” said the
head steward, pleasantly; “how are you feeling
to-day?”</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” declared Jerry, stoutly; “is
it breakfast time?”</p>

<p>“It will be pretty soon—are you hungry?”</p>

<p>“I guess I am,” said Jerry, a little doubtfully;
“what did you do with our feast?”</p>

<p>“I think the stewardess must have taken
charge of it. You didn’t seem particularly keen
about eating it yourselves last night. You can
have anything you want for breakfast.”</p>

<p>Jerry began climbing down from his high bed.</p>

<p>“I’m ready,” he announced cheerfully; “it’s
good I haven’t got to stop to dress. I never went
to bed with my clothes on before, but I like it;
it saves so much trouble. I don’t think I’ll stop
to wash. I haven’t had anything to eat since
lunch time yesterday.”</p>

<p>Just then Gretel and Geraldine woke up, and
the steward told them they were already in Baltimore
harbor, and the boat would be at her dock
in a few minutes.</p>

<p>It was more than half an hour later, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
before the three rather bedraggled little
figures made their appearance on deck. In the
meantime they had been provided with a bountiful
breakfast, to which they had all done justice,
but notwithstanding that fact, and the reassuring
knowledge that they were actually in Baltimore,
all three faces were very grave and troubled.
The stewardess had assured them that they would
be cared for, and their friends communicated
with, but that there was nothing for them to do
but remain on board all day, and go back to
Old Point on the return trip that night.</p>

<p>“It isn’t always as bad as last night,” Gretel
said, trying to speak cheerfully. “It was really
quite smooth the night Percy and I came. Perhaps
you won’t be sick going back.”</p>

<p>The twins shuddered.</p>

<p>“I think a boat is the most dreadful place in
the world,” declared Geraldine. “Oh, don’t you
suppose we could get off, and go back by the
train?”</p>

<p>Gretel shook her head decidedly.</p>

<p>“And they never made up a purse for us, after
all,” exclaimed Jerry, in a tone of disgust, and
he glanced about the almost deserted deck, for
the boat was now at her pier, and most of the
passengers had already gone on shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>The rain had ceased, but it was still cool and
cloudy, and the children shivered a little as they
stood leaning against the railing, and looked
down at the crowd of people and vehicles on the
pier.</p>

<p>“It does feel sort of queer to be wearing the
same clothes you’ve had on all night,” Geraldine
admitted, with a sigh. “Lots of things aren’t
as nice when they really happen as people think
they’re going to be beforehand. I wonder if
that’s what Mother means by learning by experience.”</p>

<p>Jerry nodded.</p>

<p>“I guess it is,” he said, “but I don’t think I
like learning by experience as much as being punished.
I say, let’s ask Mother to go back to
the old way. I don’t care much about the Law
of Love, anyway; I’d rather have one good
punishment, and get it over with; this learning
by experience business isn’t much fun.”</p>

<p>Just then there was an exclamation from Gretel.</p>

<p>“Look, oh, look; isn’t that your father on the
pier?”</p>

<p>In another second the twins were literally
hanging over the railing; their hands waving,
their voices raised in wild shouts of excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>“Father, Father, here we are,” they yelled,
jumping up and down in their sudden joy and
relief. “Oh, Father dear, we’re so glad you’ve
come, too. Please, please take us back in the
train.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>WHAT WAS “IN THE WIND”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was afternoon, and the Baltimore express
was nearing the station at Old Point.
From the window of the parlor car three
very solemn little faces were looking out at the
familiar landscape. It did not seem possible
that less than twenty-four hours had elapsed
since they had seen it last. It seemed to the
children that they must have been away for at
least a month. It had not been a cheerful journey,
for Mr. Barlow was very much annoyed,
and had had a long serious talk with his small
son and daughter, in the course of which Jerry
and Geraldine had both been reduced to repentant
tears.</p>

<p>“When Father scolds he’s much worse than
Mother,” Geraldine whispered to Gretel. “He
doesn’t get angry often, but when he does it’s
something awful. We really have been dreadfully
bad. Father says when Mother got our
letter, and found the boat had gone, she was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
frightened she had hysterics. Did you ever see
any one have hysterics?”</p>

<p>Gretel said she never had.</p>

<p>“Then you don’t want to. We’ve seen
Mother lots of times and it’s awful. Miss Heath
was frightened, too, and so was your brother.
I wonder if you’ll be punished when you get
home.”</p>

<p>“Of course she won’t,” declared Jerry, indignantly;
“it wasn’t her fault; she only came
to take care of us. I’m going to tell Mr. Douane
so the minute I see him.”</p>

<p>Gretel gave her little friend a grateful glance.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t like Percy to be angry with me,”
she said. “I wonder if he’ll be at the station.”</p>

<p>“I guess he will,” said Jerry. “Father says
he would have come on the night train to Baltimore
with him, only they couldn’t be quite sure
you were with us, so he had to stay and look for
you, but Father telegraphed this morning as soon
as he found us on the boat, so everybody knows
now.”</p>

<p>“Here’s the station,” announced Geraldine
from the car window, “and there are Mr. Douane
and Miss Heath on the platform. O dear! I
wish my hair wasn’t so mussed, and my dress
so dirty. Miss Heath always looks so neat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>They certainly were a dilapidated looking
party as they stepped from the train, and were
greeted by their waiting friends. The absence
of the usual combing and scrubbing was painfully
apparent, and all three children looked very
much the worse for wear. But Miss Heath and
Mr. Douane were so thankful to see the three
little faces again that they were quite ready to
overlook deficiencies.</p>

<p>“Mr. Douane,” said Jerry, walking straight
up to Gretel’s brother, in his honest, fearless
way, “we want to tell you right off that you
mustn’t punish Gretel. It wasn’t her fault. She
only came on the boat to make us go home, but
we wouldn’t mind her, and then the boat started,
and she had to come along, but she didn’t want
to one bit.”</p>

<p>“What did I tell you, Percy?” cried Miss
Heath, triumphantly. “I knew Gretel would
never do such a thing voluntarily.” And, to
everybody’s surprise the pretty young lady caught
Gretel in her arms and hugged her.</p>

<p>“How’s Mother?” Geraldine inquired, rather
timidly. It was quite wonderful how meek both
the twins were at that moment.</p>

<p>Miss Heath looked grave.</p>

<p>“Your mother is better this afternoon,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
said, “but she has been very ill. It was a terrible
experience for her.”</p>

<p>Miss Heath spoke in a tone the twins had
never heard her use before, and regarded the
two little culprits with such sternness in her gaze,
that they both quailed beneath it.</p>

<p>“Were you very much frightened, Pussy?”
Mr. Douane asked kindly, as he and his little
sister walked back to the hotel together.</p>

<p>“It was pretty frightening,” Gretel admitted,
slipping her hand into her brother’s as she spoke,
“but I thought God would take care of us, and
He did. Were you worried about me, Percy?”</p>

<p>“Very much indeed. When I came back
from Hampton, and Higgins met me with the
astounding news that you had gone out in the
storm without even a hat on, I could not imagine
what had happened. I went over to the Barlows’
cottage, and found myself in the midst of such
a scene of excitement as I had never even imagined.
The twins’ note had been discovered,
and poor Mrs. Barlow was in violent hysterics.
Of course we thought you must have gone with
the others, and yet it seemed very strange. Miss Heath
and Higgins were both convinced that you
would never have done such a thing, and besides,
your name was not mentioned in the note. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
can tell you it was a great relief to our minds
when Mr. Barlow’s telegram arrived this morning.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Barlow was very kind,” said Gretel.
“He bought me this hat in Baltimore before we
went on the train. I should have hated to come
all the way home without a hat. He paid the
people on the boat too, and gave the stewardess
a present for being so good to the twins when
they were seasick. I’m so glad Miss Heath
didn’t believe I went because I wanted to. She
said she always felt safe about Jerry and Geraldine
when I was with them. That’s one reason
why I ran after them when I saw them going on
the boat.”</p>

<p>“Miss Heath is coming over to see you by and
by,” said Mr. Douane, smiling. “I think she
has something to talk to you about.”</p>

<p>Gretel looked very much pleased.</p>

<p>It made her feel quite grown-up and important
to hear that a young lady wanted to talk to her.</p>

<p>“I love Miss Heath better than any one I
ever knew except Father and you,” she said;
“I’m so glad you like her, too, Percy. Don’t
you hope we shall keep on seeing her when we
go back to New York?”</p>

<p>“I most certainly do,” agreed Mr. Douane,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
and there was such an odd expression in his eyes
that Gretel regarded him rather curiously.</p>

<p>“You look as if you were very happy about
something,” she remarked wonderingly; “is it
because I’ve come back?”</p>

<p>“Partly for that reason, and partly for something
else,” her brother answered evasively, and
Gretel did not like to ask any more questions on
the subject.</p>

<p>“It was nice of Jerry to tell you why I went
with them,” she said, by way of changing the
subject. “I like Jerry very much; he’s so
honest; he doesn’t talk much, but he thinks a
lot. He’s very fond of Miss Heath, too. I’m
so glad you will want to see Miss Heath after
we leave here. It’s very sad to get fond of
people, and then never see them any more.”</p>

<p>“It is indeed,” responded her brother. “I
have had one experience of that kind myself, and
I don’t want another. I lost Miss Heath once,
but I don’t intend to lose her again if I can help
it.”</p>

<p>Gretel was much interested, and would have
liked to ask a number of questions, but at that
moment they reached the hotel, and found Higgins
eagerly watching for them from the piazza.</p>

<p>Higgins greeted her little charge with a burst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
of genuine affection. She had grown very fond
of Gretel, and her joy and triumph when she
discovered that she had been correct in her conviction
that the child had not run away voluntarily,
was almost as great as Miss Heath’s had
been. She took Gretel up-stairs to her room,
where she insisted on undressing her at once and
putting her to bed.</p>

<p>“You look about ready to drop,” she declared.
“To think hof a young lady like you going to
bed with ’er clothes on, and running hoff without
heven a comb or a tooth-brush, fairly sends
chills down my spine.”</p>

<p>Gretel protested that she was not at all tired,
but Higgins was firm, and really the warm bath,
and soft, comfortable bed were very pleasant.</p>

<p>“A bed is much more comfortable than a berth
on a steamboat,” she remarked, with a sigh of
content, as she nestled down between the cool,
clean sheets. “I wonder if Jerry and Geraldine
have gone to bed, too.”</p>

<p>Jerry and Geraldine had gone to bed, but they
were not in by any means such good spirits as
their friend. The sight of their mother’s white,
haggard face and swollen eyes, had been more
of a rebuke to the two little sinners than any
amount of punishment, and Geraldine’s first action<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
on reaching home was to fling herself on
Mrs. Barlow’s neck, with a burst of remorseful
tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother dearest, please, please punish
us,” she sobbed. “We’d rather be punished than
talked to, we really would. We’re so dreadfully
sorry, and it was most all my fault, because
Jerry never thought of it till I put the idea into
his head.”</p>

<p>It was late in the evening when Gretel awoke
from a long, refreshing nap, to find the faithful
Higgins sewing by her bedside. She was feeling
decidedly better, and also very hungry.</p>

<p>“May I have some supper?” was her first
question, when Higgins had told her what time
it was, and complimented her upon her improved
appearance.</p>

<p>Higgins said she would go down-stairs, and
order something from the dining-room.</p>

<p>“And I’ll tell Miss ’Eath you’re hawake,” she
added. “She’s been up twice halready, but you
were asleep both times. Mr. Douane told me to
let them know the minute you hawoke; they’re
hon the piazza together. I said there was something
in the wind; I know the signs.”</p>

<p>Higgins departed, leaving Gretel very much
puzzled by her last words. This was not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
first time she had heard “there was something
in the wind,” and she was beginning to be decidedly
curious as to what it could be. She was
not kept long in suspense, however, for in a very
few minutes the door opened, and Miss Heath
herself came in, looking prettier than ever, with
all her dimples showing, and the brightest color
Gretel had ever seen in her cheeks.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you came to see me,” said the
little girl joyfully, as her friend, after kissing
her, drew a chair to the bedside. “I’ve had
such a nice nap, and I’m not a bit tired now, only
hungry.”</p>

<p>“Higgins has gone to order some supper for
you,” said Miss Heath, “and while we are waiting
for it I have come to have a little chat. I
want to tell you about something which has made
me very happy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad,” cried Gretel, and she took
Miss Heath’s hand and kissed it in the pretty
foreign way her father had taught her. “I
know you must be happy; your eyes shine so.
Has somebody you love very much come to take
care of you, just as Percy came to take care of
me? But, oh, I forgot; you haven’t any brothers,
have you?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t any brothers,” said Miss Heath,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
smiling, “but you are not so far wrong in your
guess, Gretel; some one I love, and who loves
me, is going to take care of me, and I am very,
very happy.”</p>

<p>“Is it a gentleman?” inquired Gretel, with a
sudden flash of intuition, “and do you mean you
are going to be married, Miss Heath?”</p>

<p>Miss Heath laughed a rather embarrassed
laugh, and kissed Gretel again.</p>

<p>“You clever kiddie,” she said; “what made
you guess? Yes, I am going to be married to
one of the nicest men in the world—aren’t you
glad?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Gretel, with a little catch in her
voice, “I’m very glad for you, only—only if
you get married I suppose you’ll go away, and
perhaps I won’t ever see you any more. Percy
and I were talking about you this afternoon, and
we both hoped so much that we should go on
seeing you when we went back to New York.”</p>

<p>“So you shall,” promised Miss Heath. “My
home is to be in New York, or near it, and I hope
we shall love each other very dearly, Gretel.”</p>

<p>“Then I am just as glad as I can be!” cried
impulsive Gretel, and she threw her arms round
Miss Heath’s neck and hugged her.</p>

<p>Miss Heath returned the embrace heartily, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
then she took Gretel’s hand, and held it, as she
went on with her story.</p>

<p>“I have known the—the gentleman for several
years,” she said. “We met in China, and
he and my father were very good friends, but
when my father was taken ill, and we left Hong-Kong
suddenly, we lost sight of each other for
a time. When my dear father died I was very
unhappy and very lonely. I came to New York
by myself, and hired a hall bedroom in a boarding-house.
I could not afford anything better,
for my father was not rich, and when he died
there was very little money left. I have an uncle
in Chicago, who wanted to help me, but he has
a large family of his own, and I did not want to
be a burden to him. So I struggled along as
well as I could, giving music lessons to the few
pupils I could obtain, but it was a very different
life from that to which I had been accustomed.
When you told me about your life at Mrs.
Marsh’s, and how you used to long for a little
music, I thought of myself in the sad, lonely days
last winter.</p>

<p>“But one day, just when things seemed about
as bad and hopeless as they could be, I received
a kind letter from Mrs. Barlow, asking me to
join her family, come down here with them, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
teach the children for the rest of the season.
That was less than a month ago, but since then
everything has changed for me, and now I am
so happy that I don’t feel as if I could ever be
sad or lonely again.”</p>

<p>“I’m just as glad as I can be,” declared Gretel,
heartily; “it’s the nicest story I ever heard, but—but,
would you mind telling me about how
you found the gentleman again?”</p>

<p>“I found him right here at Old Point; wasn’t
it wonderful, Gretel? We had both come here
without having the least idea of finding each
other.”</p>

<p>“Do Jerry and Geraldine know about it?”
asked Gretel.</p>

<p>“Not yet, but they will to-morrow. I wanted
you to know first, because—well, you see, Gretel
dear, you know the gentleman.”</p>

<p>“I know him!” cried Gretel, sitting up in bed,
and regarding her friend with wide, astonished
eyes. “Why, I don’t know any gentleman except
Percy and Mr. Barlow, and—oh, Miss
Heath, I hope he isn’t that old Mr. Oliver, with
the bald head.”</p>

<p>Miss Heath broke into a merry laugh, which
was echoed by another laugh, as Mr. Douane—who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
had been lingering outside the door—suddenly
appeared on the threshold.</p>

<p>“Old Mr. Oliver; that is a good guess!” he
cried, merrily. “Why, he has had three wives
already, I believe. Come now, Gretel, can’t you
think who the happy man is?”</p>

<p>Gretel gazed from one happy face to the other
in growing bewilderment, but before she could
speak, Mr. Douane himself settled the question in
her mind by putting his arm round Miss Heath,
and kissing her.</p>

<p>“I do believe I’m the happiest girl in the whole
world,” sobbed Gretel. “I don’t know what
makes me cry when I’m so glad, but I can’t help
it. I thought it was beautiful enough to have a
brother, but to have a sister too—oh, Miss
Heath, dear, I’m going to try so very hard to be
good enough to deserve you.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>GOING TO A WEDDING</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“I&#8202; WISH when people have weddings, they’d
have them in the afternoon, instead of
in the morning,” observed Geraldine, in
a rather complaining tone, as she carefully
smoothed out the folds in her white dress before
taking her favorite seat on the piazza railing.
“We have to wear our good clothes in the afternoon,
anyway, but it’s simply awful to be dressed
up like this at ten o’clock in the morning.”</p>

<p>Jerry said nothing, but gazed mournfully at
his immaculate white suit, and freshly blackened
boots, and sighed. It was the first of May, as
perfect a spring day as had ever dawned, and
it was also Barbara Heath’s wedding day. The
twins were occupying the cottage piazza in solitary
state, while up-stairs Mrs. Barlow, Gretel,
and Higgins, were all engaged in dressing the
bride.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be quite so bad if it were going
to be a big wedding, like people have in New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
York,” Geraldine went on. “Then we could
look at the presents, and perhaps I could be a
flower girl, and you could hold up the bride’s
train, like Bobby Campbell did when his aunt
got married, but Miss Heath isn’t going to have
any train, and there won’t be any people in the
church but just us, and her uncle from Chicago.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t even to be any wedding cake,”
objected Jerry, disgustedly. “I thought of
course there would be cake, and we could each
have a box to ourselves.”</p>

<p>“I know why they’re not having any cake, or
flower girls, or trains,” said Geraldine. “Miss
Heath said she wanted to have a very simple wedding.
I suppose she didn’t want to have Father
and Mother pay for things, but I should think
Mr. Douane might have paid; he’s awfully
rich.”</p>

<p>“Is he really?” inquired Jerry, looking interested.</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard Father and Miss Heath’s uncle
talking about it the other night. Father said
Miss Heath was a very lucky girl, and I guess
Mr. Heath thought she was lucky, too, for he
rubbed his hands, and looked as pleased as could
be.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Miss Heath cares much,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
though,” remarked Jerry, in a tone of conviction.
“She isn’t the kind of person to like anybody
just because he’s rich. She’d marry any one she
was fond of, and she’s awfully fond of Mr.
Douane.”</p>

<p>“It’s very nice to see everybody so happy,”
said Geraldine, “but I do wish they would have
the wedding in the afternoon. It’s dreadfully
stupid to have to sit around like this in the morning,
instead of going to dress-parade. Oh, here
comes Gretel. Are they ’most ready?”</p>

<p>“Almost,” said Gretel, as she joined her
friends on the piazza. “Barbara and your
mother are having a little talk by themselves, and
I think they’re both crying. Your mother asked
me to come and see if you were all right, and
to tell you to be sure not to move off the piazza
till they come.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re not going to move,” sighed Geraldine,
resignedly. “Does Miss Heath look
pretty?”</p>

<p>“Just wait till you see her,” responded Gretel,
with shining eyes. “Higgins says Lady Violet
Cadwalader wasn’t half as pretty when she was
a bride, and she wore white satin and point lace.
Oh, Geraldine, I’m so happy I feel as if I would
like to fly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“Gretel, do you know that your brother is
very rich?” inquired Jerry. He had been much
impressed by his sister’s remark.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Gretel, simply. “You see,
when Mother married Father all her first husband’s
money went to Percy, and then his grandfather
left him a lot more besides. I used to
be afraid Percy was extravagant, but Barbara
says he isn’t, and Higgins says when people have
money they ought to spend it for the good of
trade, so I don’t worry any more. They’re going
to have a beautiful home, and I’m going to live
with them. Isn’t it wonderful? I couldn’t
quite believe it at first, but they both say they
want me. Higgins thought they would send me
to boarding-school, but Barbara says I’m not to
go till I’m fourteen, and I’m not twelve yet.”</p>

<p>“You’d better make some rules about lessons
then,” advised Geraldine. “Draw up a contract,
the way we did, and make Miss Heath
sign it. If you don’t she may want to teach you
things all day long.”</p>

<p>Gretel laughed.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe she would,” she said, “and
even if she did, I shouldn’t mind a bit. I’d
rather be with Barbara than any one else in the
world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“Well, you are a queer girl,” said Geraldine,
looking rather incredulous. “Miss Heath is all
right, and very nice for a teacher, but I can’t imagine
wanting her round all day long. Why,
the two nicest things about her getting married
are that we won’t have any more lessons this
spring, and that you are to stay with us for a
whole month, while she goes on a wedding trip.”</p>

<p>“But Miss Heath won’t be a teacher when
she’s married,” suggested Jerry. “I think she’ll
be a very nice person to live with. I wouldn’t
mind one bit living with her myself.”</p>

<p>“Mind!” cried Gretel, indignantly; “who
could possibly mind? Higgins says she considers
it a great privilege to live with such a
lovely young lady, and I think I’m the luckiest
girl in the world to have her for a sister.”</p>

<p>“Here come the carriages,” announced Jerry,
springing down from the railing, where he had
been perched beside his twin. “Oh, I hope
they’ll be ready soon. Where’s Mr. Douane,
Gretel?”</p>

<p>“He’s going to meet us at the church,” said
Gretel. “He said good-by to me at the hotel,
and I put a flower in his button-hole. He looked
perfectly splendid.”</p>

<p>Geraldine said she would go and see if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
bridal party were nearly ready, and forthwith
departed up-stairs, returning in a moment with
the joyful intelligence, that they were really coming
at last.</p>

<p>“You and I are to go in the carriage with
Father and Mother, Jerry,” she explained.
“Miss Heath wants Gretel to go with her and
her uncle. She really does look lovely, even if
she hasn’t got a train, or white satin, or anything
grand.”</p>

<p>“She couldn’t have a wedding dress like that,”
said Gretel, “because, in the first place, there
wasn’t any way of getting one made down here,
and then she and Percy are going right off in
the train as soon as the wedding is over.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why Miss Heath wouldn’t let
Father and Mother give her a wedding breakfast,
as they wanted to,” complained Jerry.
“There might have been cake then, and there
would have been lots of good things to eat, anyway.”</p>

<p>Just then the bridal party was seen coming
down-stairs, and for the moment everything else
was forgotten. Ten minutes later they were all
on their way to Hampton, for it was in the little
Episcopal church at Hampton that the wedding
was to take place. Gretel and her new sister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
sat side by side in the carriage, while Miss
Heath’s uncle from Chicago—an elderly gentleman,
with a tired, careworn face—sat opposite
to them, and looked at his watch a good many
times during the drive. Nobody talked much,
and as they drew near the church Miss Heath took
Gretel’s hand and held it. She was looking very
happy, but there were tears in her eyes, and her
lip trembled.</p>

<p>It was a very simple wedding, but that was
just what the bride and bridegroom both wanted.
The little church was decorated with spring
flowers, and as the bride walked up the aisle on
her uncle’s arm, the organ struck up the Bridal
March from “Lohengrin.” Gretel caught her
breath with a little gasp. It was the first time
she had heard that music since the day of her
stolen visit to fairy-land, and suddenly her cheeks
grew very hot.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I shall ever have the courage to
tell Barbara,” she thought, uncomfortably, but
just then the service began, and she forgot everything
else in listening to the solemn words, which
she was hearing for the first time in her life.</p>

<p>It was all over. Miss Heath was Miss Heath
no longer, but Mrs. Percy Douane, and the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
party were in the vestry, where the bride and
groom were receiving congratulations.</p>

<p>“It’s our turn now, Jerry,” whispered Geraldine,
excitedly, pulling her brother’s sleeve, when
the pretty bride had been kissed and congratulated
by Mr. Heath, Mr. and Mrs. Barlow, and delighted
Gretel. “Oh, dear, I wonder what we
ought to say.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Jerry; “I’ve been making it
up.” And he advanced, followed by his astonished
twin. It was the first time in his life
that Jerry had ever taken the initiative in anything.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he began, pausing directly in front
of the bride, and speaking in his gruffest tones.
“We want to say something. We’re glad you’re
married, and we hope you’ll be very happy. We
can’t say we’re sorry you’re not going to teach
us any more, because we don’t like teachers
much, but you’re the nicest teacher we ever had,
and if we’ve got to have one at all, we’d rather
have you than any one else.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s true,” chimed in Geraldine; “you
really have been awfully nice for a teacher, and
you’ve been so fair. You haven’t broken the
contract once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>How everybody laughed. Mrs. Douane kissed
both twins—much to Jerry’s disgust—and
hugged Geraldine so tight that she came near
crushing the bridal bouquet. And then the carriages
drove up to the church door again, and it
was time to say good-by.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Gretel darling,” Mrs. Douane
whispered, coming back to give her little sister
a last kiss. “A month will soon pass, and then
we shall all be together again, and just think how
happy we shall all be.”</p>

<p>“I am thinking of it all the time,” answered
Gretel, hastily winking back the rising tears.
“I shall count the days till the first of June,
though.”</p>

<p>At the same moment Mr. Douane was shaking
hands with Mrs. Barlow.</p>

<p>“It is mighty good of you people to take
charge of our little sister for the next month,”
he said, heartily. “I shall look up a place for the
summer as soon as possible, and hope we shall be
settled somewhere by the time you come north
in June.”</p>

<p>“Indeed you need not thank us,” said Mrs.
Barlow, smiling. “It will be a real pleasure to
have dear little Gretel with us; I know of no
sweeter companion for my children.” And this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
time Mrs. Barlow spoke as if she meant what she
said, and not as if she were quoting something
out of a book.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Jerry, waving his cap
from the church steps, as the carriage containing
the bridal couple disappeared around the corner,
“that’s over, and now we can go home and take
off our best clothes. Weddings aren’t so bad,
after all, but they’re not half so much fun as
dress-parade.”</p>

<p>“Come along, Gretel,” said Geraldine, slipping
an arm about her friend’s waist; a most unusual
demonstration of affection from her. “I’m
glad you didn’t go away, too. Miss Heath did
look lovely, and I can’t help feeling a little sorry
we’re not going to see her any more, but Mother
says we can stop at that candy store we passed,
and buy all the chocolates we want, to make up
for there not being any wedding cake.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>THE PALACE OF BEAUTY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was a lovely June afternoon, and an automobile
was bowling swiftly along the Hudson
Boulevard, away from the big, noisy
city. It was a large touring-car, and in it were
four persons. On the front seat were a lady and
gentleman, the latter of whom was running the
car himself, and in the back were a little girl
and a maid. The little girl, to whom motoring
was still a novelty, was looking about her in
wide-eyed interest, and uttering little ejaculations
of delight every few seconds.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it beautiful, Higgins?” she cried, turning
to the maid. “I didn’t know there were such
beautiful places anywhere near New York, did
you?”</p>

<p>“It’s very pretty, miss,” returned Higgins,
guardedly, “but hit hain’t to be compared with
Hengland. You should see Lord Carresford’s
hestate. Hif you could see that, Miss Gretel, you
might well call hit beautiful.”</p>

<p>But Gretel did not look convinced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“I don’t see how any place can be more beautiful
than this,” she maintained. “See that big
house on the hill? It looks just like a castle,
doesn’t it? I wonder who lives there?”</p>

<p>“Most likely some of the millionaires,” responded
Higgins, who would have died sooner
than admit that anything American could equal
her beloved England. “Hit’s a pretty place, but
hit don’t compare with what I’ve seen hin the old
country.”</p>

<p>At that moment the lady in the front seat
turned her head with the announcement—</p>

<p>“We are almost home, Gretel; that is our place
on the hill.”</p>

<p>Gretel gave a great gasp of astonishment;
speech failed her at that moment. Even the solid
Higgins opened her eyes in surprise, as the car
turned in at a pair of iron gates, and in two
minutes more had dashed up a wide avenue lined
with beautiful old trees, and drawn up before a
large stone house with pillars. It was the very
house Gretel had described as “looking like a
castle.”</p>

<p>“Well, how do you like it, Gretel?” her
brother asked, smiling, as he sprang out of the
car, and came to help Higgins unpack their belongings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>“It’s the most beautiful place I ever saw,” declared
Gretel, finding her voice at last. “Is
this really where you and Barbara live, and am I
going to live here, too?”</p>

<p>“We are going to spend the summer here, at
any rate,” Mr. Douane answered. “I have
rented the place for six months.”</p>

<p>“Come in, Gretel,” said her sister-in-law, “I
want to show you your room.” And she led the
way into a wide hall hung with pictures.</p>

<p>“I really believe it is a castle,” laughed Gretel,
pausing on the threshold to gaze about her with
eager, delighted eyes. “I feel as if I must be a
princess, and you and Percy are the king and
queen.”</p>

<p>“Poor little Cinderella,” said Mrs. Douane,
and there was a sudden dimness in her eyes, as
she led the way up the wide staircase to the second
floor.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t a castle, but just a dear old house,
filled with beautiful things. The old lady who
owns it was a friend of my mother’s, and she has
let us have the place just as it is. I used to visit
here when I was a little girl, and have always
loved the house, so when I heard that Mrs. Atterbury
was going abroad this summer, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
wanted to rent her place, I persuaded Percy to
come and look at it, and he was as much delighted
as I was. We have even taken the old servants;
two of them have lived here for more than twenty
years and knew me when I wasn’t as old as you.
This is your room, right opposite mine. Come
in and see how you like it.”</p>

<p>“Like it!” cried Gretel, and that was really
all she could say just then. It was such a pretty
room, with such lovely old furniture in it, and the
walls were covered with charming prints and engravings.
There were two big windows looking
off toward the river, and the mountains on the
opposite shore; and the little white bed, with its
dainty furnishings was truly a joy to behold. But
it was not any of these things which caused
Gretel to spring forward, with a little cry. It
was the sight of an old rag doll sitting in solemn
state by one of the windows, and a row of shabby
old books on a shelf over the writing-desk.</p>

<p>“They’re my own things, my own precious
things!” she cried, snatching up the rag doll, and
hugging it to her heart. “This is my Jemima,
that Father gave me for a Christmas present,
when I was only seven, and there are all my dear,
dear books and the German Bible, and everything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“Open the desk and see what is inside,” said
Mrs. Douane, smiling.</p>

<p>With trembling hands, Gretel opened one of
the drawers in the writing-desk, and there lay a
pile of old letters, tied together with a piece of
faded blue ribbon. Gretel gave one little sob as
she caught them up and kissed them. They were
her greatest treasure of all; the letters from her
father.</p>

<p>“Oh, Barbara, how did you get them?” she
cried, rapturously. “Percy said I should have
them again, but I didn’t believe I really could. I
was so afraid Mrs. Marsh had thrown them away.
She said she hated keeping old things; they cluttered
up drawers and made more trouble in house-cleaning.”</p>

<p>With a sudden impulse, Mrs. Douane took her
little sister in her arms, and kissed her.</p>

<p>“You dear child,” she said. “Of course Mrs.
Marsh did not throw away your treasures; she
would not have dared to do such a thing. Percy
wrote her from Old Point, asking her to keep
everything until he could send for them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so happy,” cried Gretel. “I think
I’m the happiest person in the world. Did Percy
go to see Mrs. Marsh?”</p>

<p>“No, he wrote to her, giving the address, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
she sent the parcel at once. Percy also received
a note from Miss Marsh, announcing her engagement
to a Mr. Pendleton. She expects to be
married this month.”</p>

<p>Gretel looked pleased.</p>

<p>“I’m glad,” she said; “I liked Mr. Pendleton;
he was always very kind. Once when he came
to see Ada he brought me some chocolates.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am glad, too, if you are,” laughed
Mrs. Douane, “though I never had the pleasure
of meeting Miss Ada. Here comes Higgins, and
I am going to leave you to wash off some of that
horrid dust while I get ready for dinner. Dust
is really the only drawback to motoring.”</p>

<p>But Gretel did not think that even dust could
be considered a drawback to such a delightful
amusement. She had never been so happy or
excited in her life, and it was rather hard work
to stand still and have her hair brushed and tied
with a fresh ribbon, while there was still so much
to see and admire in this beautiful new home.
The past month had been a very pleasant one.
Mr. and Mrs. Barlow had been as kind as possible,
and she and the twins had become the best
of friends. They had remained at Old Point
until the first of June, and then gone to Washington
for a week on their way north. Gretel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
had seen the Capitol, and the White House, and
spent one delightful afternoon at Mount Vernon,
wandering about the beautiful old home of
General Washington. They had left Washington
only that morning, and on reaching the station
in New York, Gretel had been met by her
brother and sister in their new touring-car. It
had been a rather sad parting, for at the last
moment, Geraldine—to everybody’s surprise—had
suddenly burst into tears, and flinging her
arms round Gretel’s neck, had positively refused
to be parted from her friend. It was not until
Mr. and Mrs. Douane had given the twins a most
urgent invitation to visit Gretel in her new home,
that Geraldine had at last consented to be torn
away, and allow Gretel to depart with her
family.</p>

<p>The dinner that evening was another revelation
to Gretel. The prettily decorated table,
with a big bowl of roses in the center; the neat,
white-capped maid, who waited on them, and her
sister-in-law, looking lovelier than ever in her
white evening dress, all combined to fill the little
girl with wonder and admiration.</p>

<p>“It is a palace, and Percy and Barbara are the
prince and princess,” she told herself. “I’m
Cinderella, and I’ve come to live with them, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
oh, how dreadful it would be if it should all come
to an end when the clock strikes twelve.”</p>

<p>“What are you thinking of, Gretel?” her
brother asked, noticing the look of sudden anxiety
on the child’s hitherto radiant face.</p>

<p>Gretel laughed and blushed.</p>

<p>“It was very silly,” she said, “but I couldn’t
help it. I was thinking how perfectly wonderful
everything was, and then just for a minute I
thought how terrible it would be if it should all
come to an end just as it did with Cinderella
when the clock struck twelve.”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Douane both smiled, and the
latter said—</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t worry about it, if I were you.
This little Cinderella has come home to stay, and
we are all going to have a happy summer together.”</p>

<p>“By the way, Barbara,” said Mr. Douane,
“I saw the man about that pony this morning.
I am going to have you learn to ride, Gretel; it’s
the best exercise in the world, and we must have
you fat and rosy before you go to school in the
autumn.”</p>

<p>It was a beautiful moonlight night, and after
dinner they all went out on the piazza, and sat
watching the boats on the river. It was so still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
that they could hear the band on the Albany
steamer, as it passed, and so warm that scarcely
a leaf stirred. Gretel would have liked to linger
there for hours, with the two people she loved
best in the world, but at nine o’clock her sister-in-law
advised her to go to bed.</p>

<p>“You have been traveling all day,” she said,
“and need a good night’s rest.”</p>

<p>“I feel so wide awake that I don’t think I
can possibly go to sleep,” said Gretel, rising
rather reluctantly, “but I’ll try if you want me
to.” And she kissed her brother and sister good night,
and went up-stairs to her pretty room,
where she found the faithful Higgins busy unpacking.</p>

<p>Gretel had so many things to say to Higgins,
that the process of undressing was a rather
lengthy one, but it was over at last, and Higgins,
having seen her charge safely in bed, was
preparing to leave the room, when Gretel called
her back.</p>

<p>“Higgins,” she said a little timidly, “I don’t
believe you are very fond of being kissed, are
you?”</p>

<p>“I’m not much haddicted to hit,” admitted
Higgins, who was fond of using long words.
“In fact, I ’aven’t kissed any one since I said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
good-by to my mother hin the hold country.
What do you want to know for, miss?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking that—but perhaps you’d
rather not do it,” said Gretel, evasively. “It’s
only that I’m so very happy to-night, I feel as
if I should like to kiss everybody in the world.”</p>

<p>“You mean you would like to kiss me, miss?”
There was something like consternation in Higgins’
voice, but she flushed all over her plain face,
and looked for the moment really quite embarrassed.</p>

<p>“I should like to very much indeed if you
wouldn’t mind,” said Gretel, and as the English
woman bent down her face, she threw two soft
little arms round Higgins’ neck, and kissed her
heartily.</p>

<p>Higgins did not say anything, but switched
out the light very hurriedly, and Gretel did not
see the tears in her eyes, or hear her murmur
softly as she left the room—</p>

<p>“There never was a sweeter child hin this
country or the hold one either.”</p>

<p>It was quite true that Gretel was not sleepy.
She was far too happy and excited to sleep, and
she lay for some time, with wide-open eyes, living
over all the delightful events of the day. She
had taken the old rag doll to bed with her, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
slipped the packet of her father’s letters under
her pillow. It was so good to know that all her
treasures were safe, and in her own possession
once more. She was just beginning to feel a
little sleepy, when her ear caught the sound of a
distant piano, and she started up wide awake
again.</p>

<p>“It’s Barbara!” she cried joyfully. “Oh,
what a beautiful ending to the day to hear Barbara
play before I go to sleep.”</p>

<p>She had no idea of doing anything wrong, or
even unusual, as she sprang out of bed, and
hastily putting on her wrapper and bath slippers—which
Higgins had left on a chair by the bedside—opened
the door, and stole softly out into
the hall. In the old studio days she had often
sat up till midnight while her father and his
friends played and sang. Yes, Barbara was
playing, and eager to get as near as possible to
the music she loved, Gretel went on to the head
of the stairs. The drawing-room door was
directly opposite the staircase, and Gretel could
hear every note as distinctly as if she had been
in the room. With a little sigh of utter content,
she sat down on the top stair, intending to
enjoy another sensation of bliss before going
back to bed again. The moonlight streaming in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
through the hall window, fell across the little
figure in the blue flannel wrapper, and rested
softly on the child’s rapt face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Douane finished the nocturne she was
playing, and in the pause which followed, Gretel
heard her brother say—</p>

<p>“Play something from Wagner.”</p>

<p>“I’ll play The Swan Song from ‘Lohengrin,’”
his wife answered, and after turning over some
music, she began a melody Gretel knew, and
which set the child’s heart to beating fast, while
the hot color rushed up into her cheeks. How
well she remembered it all; the crowded opera
house; the beautiful scene; the great orchestra,
and the clear tenor voice of Lohengrin, singing
the farewell to his beloved swan. Then the coming
out into the cold, windy street and the shame
and remorse that followed.</p>

<p>Suddenly the music stopped.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” Mr. Douane asked, in
surprise; “have you forgotten it?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t forgotten it,” his wife answered,
with something between a sob and a
laugh, “but I can’t play it to-night; my heart is
too full. I haven’t played Lohengrin since—why
I don’t believe I ever told you about my
tragic experience last winter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“You have told me of experiences which
seemed to me sufficiently tragic, but what is this
particular one?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I was foolish to take it as seriously
as I did,” said Mrs. Douane. “It really wasn’t
as tragic as many other things, but it came at
a time when I had just about reached the end of
my tether, and you know it is always the last
straw that breaks the camel’s back. It was in
March, and I was about as blue and discouraged
as any one well could be. I had been hungering
for a little music for once, but never felt I could
spare the money for a ticket to a concert. Then
one day I happened to see in the paper that they
were giving ‘Lohengrin’ at the Saturday matinée
that week, and the temptation proved too
great to be resisted. I struggled with my economical
scruples for two days, and then on Friday
afternoon, I let scruples go to the winds,
went to the opera house, and bought a ticket
for the balcony. It cost me three dollars, and
I knew I hadn’t a dollar to waste on frivolities,
but it was my one dissipation of the winter.</p>

<p>“I hurried home with my treasure, feeling
like a naughty child, who has stolen a piece of
cake, and then what do you suppose I discovered?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>“What?” inquired Mr. Douane, as his wife
paused dramatically, and Gretel, on the stairs,
held her breath, and leaned forward to catch
every word.</p>

<p>“I had lost my ticket,” said Mrs. Douane,
solemnly.</p>

<p>“Lost your ticket?” repeated her husband;
“how did it happen—where did you put it?”</p>

<p>“In my purse, I thought, but it must have
dropped out, for I found the clasp unfastened.
I really don’t think I ever had quite such a shock
in my life. I rushed back to the opera house,
hoping the ticket might have been picked up and
returned to the box office, but of course it was
of no use. It was a very windy day, and the
envelope may have been blown away, nobody
knows where. There was nothing to be done
but go home and bear the disappointment as well
as I could.”</p>

<p>“Poor little girl,” said Mr. Douane, tenderly,
“I can imagine what it meant to you. I should
like to find the fellow who picked up that ticket,
and give him a piece of my mind. Any one
should have known that the proper thing to do
was to return it to the box office. Did you go
back again? It might have been returned later,
you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>“Oh, yes, I tried twice more before giving up
all hope. Unfortunately, I did not remember
the number of my seat, and the man at the box
office assured me there was no hope. Whoever
found the ticket must have used it, but perhaps
it was never picked up at all. I think I was about
as unhappy that night as any girl could be, but
you know the old saying, ‘The darkest hour is
always just before dawn.’ It was the very next
day that Mrs. Barlow’s letter came, asking me
to go to Old Point, and it was only a week later
that you and I met; so I ought not to complain,
ought I?”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps not, but I still maintain that
I should like to find the person who picked up
that ticket. It was a confoundedly dishonest
trick not to have handed it in at the box office.”</p>

<p>Mr. Douane said a good deal more, but that
was all Gretel heard. As silently as it had come,
the little figure on the stairs rose and slipped
away. The child’s face was very white, and her
eyes were big and frightened. When she reached
her own room, she closed the door softly, and
sank down in a little heap on the bed. She was
trembling all over.</p>

<p>“It was Barbara’s ticket to fairy-land, and I
stole it,” she whispered. “Percy said it was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
confoundedly dishonest thing to do. Barbara
loves ‘Lohengrin’ as much as I do, and she was
poor, too. I knew I had been wicked, but I
never knew I’d really been dishonest. I love
Barbara better than any one in the world, and
I stole her ticket to fairy-land!”</p>

<p>Poor little repentant Cinderella! Her happy
day was over; the clock had struck twelve.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>AFTER THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was still very early the next morning when
Gretel awoke; a robin was singing on a
tree just outside her window, but everything
else was still. For the first few bewildered
moments she could not remember where she was,
or what had happened, and lay wondering idly
why her head ached, and her eyes felt so stiff
and swollen. Then it all came back with a rush;
the music, Barbara’s story, and those dreadful
words of her brother’s. Afterwards the long
hours she had lain awake, alone in the darkness,
trying to make up her mind what she ought to
do. She had cried herself to sleep at last, having
finally decided upon the course of action, which
it seemed to the poor foolish little girl, was the
right one to take.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to tell them; I’ve got to; I’ve got
to,” she had told herself resolutely. “I couldn’t
go on living here, letting them love me, and be
good to me, and not tell them I was a dishonest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
person. Of course they won’t ever love me any
more when they know, but I can’t help that.
Percy will be so ashamed to have a dishonest girl
for a sister, and Barbara won’t want to ever see
me again.”</p>

<p>It was a terrible thought, but it had to be faced.
It never occurred to Gretel for a moment that
the ticket she had picked up on the sidewalk, in
front of the opera house, might not be the one
her sister-in-law had lost. “Lohengrin”—the
windy afternoon—the date—everything pointed
too plainly to the fact that the tickets were one
and the same.</p>

<p>And now it was morning, and she must begin
her preparations, or it would be too late to carry
out the plan she had decided upon. If she waited
until people were up, she might be stopped and
asked awkward questions, and she must get away
before Percy and Barbara knew—she could
never face them after that, she would be too much
ashamed. With as little noise as possible, she
crept out of bed, and began putting on her
clothes. How merrily the birds sang and how
brightly the sun was shining. She remembered
that this was to have been her first day in her
beautiful new home. But she never wavered
for a moment in her purpose. It did not take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
long to dress, for she had decided to omit her
usual morning bath, lest the sound of running
water should disturb the still sleeping household.
She was just fastening her dress when another
sound besides the singing of the birds, broke the
early morning stillness; the shrill whistle of a
passing train, and she suddenly remembered that
Percy had told her the railway station was not
more than half a mile away.</p>

<p>“I’m glad it isn’t far,” she said to herself,
with a feeling of something like relief; “I can
easily walk there, and there must be plenty of
trains going to New York. I’ve got enough
money for a ticket. I’m glad I didn’t spend all
the ten dollars Percy gave me the day before the
wedding.” And she slipped into her pocket the
pretty little silver purse her brother had given
her.</p>

<p>This done, Gretel opened the closet door, in
quest of her hat. At sight of the row of pretty
frocks that Higgins had unpacked the night before,
she was conscious of a sharp little stab of
pain.</p>

<p>“It’s dreadful to have to leave all those lovely
things,” she said, with a sob. “It doesn’t seem
quite grateful either, when Percy was so good
to buy them all for me, but I couldn’t stay and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
not tell, and when he knows I’m a dishonest
person he won’t want me anyway. Perhaps they
can find some other girl to give the clothes to,
who will deserve them more than I did.”</p>

<p>She selected her plainest hat, and began putting
a few necessary toilet articles into the suit-case
Higgins had left on the lowest shelf of the closet.
Having procured a night-gown, and a fresh set
of underclothes from the bureau drawer, she
hesitated for a moment, and then drew the packet
of old letters from beneath her pillow, and tucked
it carefully away in one corner of the suit-case.
She glanced regretfully at the row of shabby
books, but decided it would not be possible to
carry them, and tried to comfort herself with
the reflection that Barbara would take care of
them for her—Barbara was always so kind.</p>

<p>Her preparations completed, Gretel sat down
at the desk to write her confession. She selected
a sheet of paper; dipped her pen in the ink, and
began to write; but her fingers trembled so she
could scarcely form the letters, and it was a very
blotted, illegible little note that Higgins, coming
in an hour later to wake her little charge, found
on the desk, addressed to Mr. Percy Douane.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Darling Percy</span>”: it began.</p>

<p>“When you get this I shall have gone away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
and you and Barbara won’t ever see me any more.
I suppose it would be much braver if I stayed and
told you myself instead of writing, but I am not
at all brave.</p>

<p>“Dear Percy, I may as well say it right away,
I am a dishonest person. I stole Barbara’s ticket
to fairy-land—I mean the opera. I didn’t know
it was hers till last night, but I always knew it was
somebody’s. I found it on the sidewalk, and I
kept it, and went to hear Lohengrin. I knew it
was wicked, but I wanted to hear Lohengrin more
than anything else in the world, and I thought
nobody would ever find out. Nobody ever did,
but now I know it was Barbara’s ticket, I can’t
keep the secret any longer.</p>

<p>“It happened the very afternoon you came
home. I was going to tell you once, but you said
to let bygones be bygones, and I was so glad, because
I thought if you knew you might not love
me, and nobody had loved me since Father died.
If I hadn’t found out it was Barbara’s ticket I
am afraid I might never have told, but I couldn’t
go on living here in this beautiful place, and having
everybody so good to me, and not have you
know I was a dishonest person. If I didn’t tell
now, I should be a great deal more dishonest than
I was before.</p>

<p>“I am going to some old friends of Father’s in
New York, and I think they’ll let me stay with
them till I can earn some money. I don’t play
the piano at all well now, but I play much better
than a boy I know, and he said his father was going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
to get him into vaudeville, so I think perhaps
Fritz Lipheim can get me into vaudeville, too, and
just as soon as I have earned three dollars I will
send it to Barbara, to pay for that ticket. I
heard her tell you it cost three dollars.</p>

<p>“Please don’t be any angrier with me than you
can help. I know you can’t ever love me any
more, because you love Barbara so much, and it
was her ticket, but she is so good I think perhaps
she will forgive me when she knows how sorry
and ashamed I am.</p>

<p>“Good-by, dear Percy; thank you a million
times for all the beautiful things you have done
for me, and please try to forgive me if you possibly
can.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Your loving little sister,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Gretel</span>.</p>

<p>“PS. I am not taking any more clothes than
I can help. I hope you will be able to find some
other little girl to give them to, for I know she
will love them as much as I did.”</p>
</div>

<p>Gretel was not at all satisfied with her letter
when she read it over, but there was no time to
write another, for already the clock on the stairs
was striking six, and in another half hour the
servants would be up and about. So, having put
the poor little confession in the most conspicuous
place on the desk and given one more glance
about the pretty room, which was to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
hers, she opened her door, and stepped softly out
into the silent hall. How very still it was;
evidently the household was still in bed and
asleep. Gretel stole on tiptoe past her brother’s
closed door, and down the front stairs to the
lower hall. The front door was fastened, but
the key turned easily in the lock, and two minutes
later a little figure, carrying a heavy suit-case,
was walking rapidly down the broad avenue to
the gate.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of a very hot day, but
as yet the air felt fresh and cool, and the sun
only comfortably warm. How beautiful it all
was, with the dew sparkling on the grass in the
bright morning sunshine, and birds singing in
every tree. Gretel paused at the gate for one
last long look, and a big lump rose in her throat,
but still she did not waver in her purpose. With
one quickly suppressed sob, she turned resolutely
away, and in another moment Cinderella had
turned her back on the palace of beauty, and was
trudging away down the dusty road to the station.</p>

<p>It was still too early for many people to be
about, and Gretel did not meet a single person
between her brother’s house and the little country
station, which she remembered having passed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
the motor-car the evening before. The station
was closed and locked, and she was beginning to
wonder what she should do next when a train
came puffing up to the platform. Gretel sprang
forward eagerly, her poor little heart pounding
so that she could scarcely breathe.</p>

<p>“Is this train going to New York?” she inquired
of the brakeman.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the man, regarding her
rather curiously; “want to get on?”</p>

<p>“I—I haven’t any ticket,” faltered Gretel;
“I’ve got the money for one, but the station is
shut up.”</p>

<p>“You can pay on the train,” the man assured
her. “Hurry up if you want to get on board;
we only stop here one minute.”</p>

<p>Without another word, Gretel hastily mounted
the steps of one of the cars, the brakeman good-naturedly
helping her with her suit-case, glancing
behind him at the same time, as though in
expectation of more passengers.</p>

<p>“Going to New York all by yourself?” he
inquired in some surprise.</p>

<p>Gretel nodded.</p>

<p>“Pretty early in the morning to be going to
town, ain’t it? Expecting somebody to meet
you at the Grand Central?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“I am going to some friends in New York,”
said Gretel, and there was so much dignity in her
tone, that the brakeman decided she must be able
to take care of herself, and asked no further questions.</p>

<p>“It’s quite true, I am going to friends,” Gretel
told herself, as she sank into an empty seat.
“Mrs. Lipheim is my friend, and so is Fritz.
I know they’ll both be glad to see me, even if
they didn’t invite me, and I haven’t heard from
them in such a long time.”</p>

<p>She recalled the many acts of kindness shown
her by Fritz Lipheim and his mother in the old
studio days, and at the time of her father’s death.
She had once gone to have supper with Mrs.
Lipheim, and she remembered the cozy little flat,
and the kind old German woman bustling about
her neat kitchen. The thought of that supper
reminded her of the fact that she had had no
breakfast that morning, and she suddenly realized
that she was very hungry.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I shall be late for the Lipheims’
breakfast,” she thought a little uneasily, “but
they are so kind, they’ll be sure to give me something
to eat.”</p>

<p>She had never forgotten the Lipheims’ address,
although she had not been there since her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
father’s death. She had once asked Mrs. Marsh
if she might go to see her old friends, but that
lady had refused so decidedly that she had never
dared broach the subject again. Since her
brother’s return she had not been in New York
long enough to make calls, especially as the Lipheims
lived in Harlem, but Barbara had promised
to take her some day to see her kind old friends.
And now she was going all by herself, but under
what sadly different circumstances from any she
had anticipated.</p>

<p>When the conductor came to collect the tickets,
Gretel explained about the closed station, and
taking out her purse, inquired the price of a trip
to New York. The conductor looked at her
much as the brakeman had done, but she seemed
such a capable little person, and so thoroughly
convinced of what she wanted to do, that he
decided it was none of his business, and walked
away, after receiving her fare, and returning the
proper change.</p>

<p>It was a slow train, and made a great many
stops. As they neared the city, the car began to
fill up, chiefly with men and women on their way
to work, but no one took any particular notice of
the solitary little girl. Gretel’s heart grew
heavier and heavier. She heard a man in the seat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
behind her say it was half-past seven. By this
time Higgins must have come to call her, and
have found her letter to Percy. How shocked
and pained they must all be when they learned
the dreadful truth about her. Of course they
would never want to have anything more to do
with her now they knew her to be a dishonest
person. A big tear splashed down on Gretel’s
cheek, and was quickly followed by another, but
the child brushed them away hurriedly, fearing
the passengers might see that she was crying.
Gretel was a proud child, and she did not want
to be pitied or questioned by strangers.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>ALONE IN THE BIG CITY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was eight o’clock when the train steamed
slowly into the Grand Central, and Gretel,
with the heavy suit-case clutched tightly in
her arms, made her way out into the crowded
station. The bustle and confusion bewildered
her a little, although she had been accustomed to
the city all her life. The roar of the elevated
trains; the shouting of cab drivers, and the pushing,
jostling throngs, made her feel all at once
very lonely, and rather frightened. Her head
was beginning to ache, too, and she was more
than ever conscious of the fact that she had not
had any breakfast. Still, it never occurred to
her to stop and buy something to eat, although
there was still nearly two dollars left in her
purse. Her one thought was to reach the
Lipheims’ flat as soon as possible.</p>

<p>At the corner of Forty-second Street she
paused for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>“East One Hundred and Sixth Street,” she said
to herself; “I must take the Third Avenue
Elevated.” And she turned resolutely eastward.</p>

<p>Early as it still was, the streets were almost
unbearably hot. The air which had felt so cool
and fresh in the country, was oppressive with
heat and smoke, and Gretel’s suit-case was very
heavy. By the time the little girl had reached
the elevated station, and climbed the long flight
of stairs to the platform, she felt as tired as if
she had been walking miles. She was fortunate,
however, in getting a seat in a train bound for
Harlem, and it felt cooler up there on a level
with people’s second story windows, than it had
done in the street below.</p>

<p>The ride uptown was not unpleasant, but it
was soon over, and then Gretel found herself
standing on a street corner, in a part of the city
that was quite unfamiliar to her. She felt bewildered,
and uncertain as to which direction she
ought to turn.</p>

<p>“I can’t remember whether it was east or west
of Third Avenue,” she said to herself, wondering
why her head felt so uncomfortably light.
“I’ll try east first and see if the numbers are
right.”</p>

<p>She turned down a shabby street, where a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
many children were playing on the sidewalk, but
after walking a short distance, and scanning the
numbers of the houses, she decided that she had
made a mistake, and should have crossed the
avenue and gone west. So, with a sigh, she
turned and retraced her steps to the corner.
Having safely crossed the avenue, despite the
constant procession of trucks and trolley cars, she
once more began an anxious scrutiny of the
numbers on the houses. Yes, she was right this
time; these were the two hundreds, and two
hundred and seventeen was the number of which
she was in search. Her heart began to beat very
fast again as she neared her destination. After
all, it was a long time since she had seen or heard
of the Lipheims. Suppose they had moved.
Suddenly she stopped short, with a little cry of
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Why, why,” she gasped, her eyes growing
round with dismay, “that is the house, I’m sure,
but—but they’re tearing it down. Nobody can
be living there now.”</p>

<p>It was too true. A gang of workmen were
engaged in demolishing a building, which had
evidently once been an apartment-house; already
the doors and windows had been taken out, and
a part of the walls were down. Gretel stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
quite still, staring stupidly before her. The shock
was so sudden and unexpected that for the first
few moments she could do nothing but stare in
helpless bewilderment. Then, with a great effort,
she pulled herself together, and approached one
of the workmen.</p>

<p>“Would you please tell me if this house used
to be two hundred and seventeen?” she inquired
timidly.</p>

<p>“It was that,” the Irishman answered, good-naturedly,
“and it’s going to be the same number
when it’s made over into a model apartment-house.”</p>

<p>“I—I suppose you don’t know where the
people who used to live here have moved to?”</p>

<p>“I do not. Are you looking for somebody
who used to live in two seventeen?”</p>

<p>Gretel nodded, and the man regarded the
white, tired little face more attentively.</p>

<p>“Maybe you could find out in one of them
stores on the corner,” he suggested, and Gretel,
having thanked the friendly Irishman, turned,
and once more walked back to the noisy corner.</p>

<p>There was a small grocery on the corner, and
Gretel, who had not been unfamiliar with such
places in the old studio days, went in, and put
her question to the young man behind the counter.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>“I am looking for some people who used to
live in number two seventeen,” she explained;
“their name is Lipheim. I thought perhaps you
could tell me where they have moved.”</p>

<p>“Lipheim, Lipheim,” the young man repeated;
“I sort of remember the name, but—oh, yes,
I know, an old German lady, who talked queer
English?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s Mrs. Lipheim,” said Gretel, eagerly,
“she speaks very broken English. Her son
plays the violin—do you know where they live
now?”</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t say,” he said. “The old lady was
in here one day just before they began tearing
down those houses, and she told me they were
going somewhere in the Bronx, but she didn’t
leave any address. Wouldn’t you like to sit
down for a few minutes? It’s a hot morning,
and your bag’s pretty heavy.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” said Gretel; “you are very
kind, but I’ve got to find Mrs. Lipheim.” And
she turned resolutely away.</p>

<p>She inquired at every store on the block, but
always with the same discouraging result. Some
of the shopkeepers did not remember the
Lipheims at all; others had known them as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
customers, but nobody appeared to have the
slightest idea where they had gone.</p>

<p>“What shall I do—oh, what shall I do
now?” thought Gretel, as she came out of the
last shop, and stood looking helplessly up and
down the avenue. “Nobody knows where
they’ve moved to, and how can I possibly find
them?”</p>

<p>But if she did not find the Lipheims, to whom
should she go? That was the terrible question,
and suddenly Gretel began to tremble, and her
head felt so queer she was obliged to lean against
a lamppost for support.</p>

<p>“I’m all alone,” whispered the poor child, with
a sob, “and I don’t know where to go.”</p>

<p>All at once, she realized that she was both very
tired and very hungry. Still, it did not occur to
her to buy any food. She must find somebody
to take care of her, and help her to earn some
money, but who was it to be? Rapidly she ran
over in her mind the names of the few people
she knew. There were the Barlows. Jerry and
Geraldine would be glad to see her, and Mr. and
Mrs. Barlow were always kind, but if they knew
she was a dishonest person, would they want to
have anything more to do with her? She remembered
Geraldine had said her mother was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
very particular about what children she and Jerry
associated with. If Mrs. Barlow knew that she
had stolen a ticket to fairy-land, she might refuse
to allow her children to associate with her,
and, oh, she could not bear that—she would be
so terribly ashamed. There were Mrs. Marsh and
Ada, but she did not want to go back to them.
Besides, it was not at all likely they would take
her back, since Mrs. Marsh and Percy had quarreled,
and Percy was no longer paying her board.
She thought of several friends of her father’s,
who had once been kind to her, but she had no
idea where they lived. She remembered the long
list of maids who had come and gone during her
year with Mrs. Marsh, but the only one among
them for whom she had cared in the least was
Dora Grubb. Dora had always been kind, and
then there were Lillie and Peter. Peter must
be in a vaudeville company by this time. Surely
he and his family were the very people most
likely to be able to help her now. If she only
knew where they lived! She remembered that
Dora had once spoken of her family as “living
uptown on the East Side.” It was rather vague,
but still she might be able to find them if she
tried very hard. This was “uptown,” and it
was also “the East Side.” She could keep on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
walking until—well, until something happened.
So, with a weary sigh, she clutched the heavy
suit-case more tightly, and moved on slowly
along the crowded, noisy street.</p>

<p>It was nearly two hours later, and Gretel was
still plodding wearily on. She had walked a
very long way, how far she did not know. The
part of the city she was in was quite strange to
her, and she had no very clear idea as to just
where she was. The scorching June sun was
beating down upon her, and it seemed to be growing
hotter every minute. She no longer felt any
desire for food. A faint, sick feeling was creeping
over her, which rendered the thought of
breakfast anything but agreeable. Every few
minutes she was obliged to stop, and set her suit-case
down on the sidewalk. She was tired, oh,
so tired; there was no use in trying to keep the
tears back any longer, and she let them come
thick and fast. She had met plenty of boys and
girls, but none among them had at all resembled
her old acquaintances Peter and Lillie Grubb.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any use; I can’t carry it any
longer,” she said, with a sob, as she set her
burden down for at least the tenth time in the
past hour. “I’ll have to leave it somewhere.”</p>

<p>She looked about for a suitable hiding-place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
but none presented itself. She had turned from
a dirty cross street into a wide avenue, noisy
with the clang of trolleys, and the roar of an
elevated train. There was nothing to be done
but leave the suit-case where she was, even at
the risk of its being carried off long before she
could come back for it. But first she would
secure her greatest treasure; the packet of old
letters. So, having removed the precious package,
and slipped it into her pocket—which was
fortunately a large one—she resigned the suit-case
to its fate, and prepared to resume her hopeless
quest.</p>

<p>There was a dull pain in her head, and queer
lights were beginning to dance before her eyes,
which at times prevented her seeing very clearly
where she was going. Suddenly she realized that
she was walking on the sunny side of the street,
and that if she crossed the avenue she would be
in the shade. How stupid she had been not to
think of that before. She would go over to the
shade, and sit down somewhere to rest for a
little while. Perhaps when she had rested she
would feel better. So, with one regretful glance
at the suit-case, which must be left behind, she
stepped off the curb and started to cross the
avenue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>A small boy with his hands in his pockets, was
sauntering slowly down the shady side of
Second Avenue. It was much too hot to walk
fast, and besides, he was in no hurry. It was not
yet eleven o’clock, and he dared not present himself
before his mother and sisters until noon. For
this was a school day, and he had not appeared
at the school building at the usual morning hour.
In plain English, he was playing truant. He
had decided that a swim at one of the free baths
would be much more agreeable than spending
three hours in a stuffy school-room on that hot
morning, but his mother was not a believer in
“the law of love,” and consequently, he was not
anxious to be seen by his family before the noon
lunch hour.</p>

<p>The swim had proved most refreshing, but
one was not allowed to remain in the free baths
for an indefinite period, and hence it was that he
found himself wandering aimlessly down Second
Avenue at eleven o’clock in the morning, with
nothing particular to do for the next hour.</p>

<p>Suddenly his attention was attracted by a small
crowd gathered on a corner and he quickened
his steps, in the hope of discovering something
of interest.</p>

<p>“I bet it’s an accident,” he remarked aloud,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
with a brightening face. He was not at all a
cruel boy, but an accident meant an excitement,
and excitement was what Peter Grubb craved
more than anything else in the world.</p>

<p>“It is an accident,” he added, as he drew
nearer the scene of action; “the cars are stopped;
somebody must have got run over.” And he
quickened his pace to a run.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” he demanded breathlessly of
another youth of about his own age, as he shouldered
his way through the crowd.</p>

<p>“Kid got knocked down by a trolley car,” was
the answer; “they’ve carried her into the drug
store, and there’s been an ambulance call.”</p>

<p>Peter’s heart began to beat faster. Not that
he felt any particular interest in the unfortunate
“kid,” but to see some one taken off to the hospital
in an ambulance was always an exciting experience,
and one that could be related afterwards
to a group of interested friends. So he wasted
no more time in asking questions, but made his
way through the open door of the drug store,
round which a sympathizing crowd was hovering.</p>

<p>It did not take Peter long to see what had happened.
They had laid the injured child on the
counter, and some one was trying to stanch the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
blood, which flowed from a deep cut on her forehead.
Her eyes were closed, and she lay very
still.</p>

<p>“Is she killed?” Peter inquired in a rather
awed whisper.</p>

<p>“No, we don’t think so,” answered the man
to whom he put the question. “I saw it happen,
and the motor-man got the brakes on just in
time. She’s badly hurt, though, I’m afraid;
there’s an ugly cut on her head, and she was
unconscious when we picked her up.”</p>

<p>“Does anybody know who the little girl is?”
somebody asked.</p>

<p>A policeman, who was among the crowd in the
doorway, stepped forward.</p>

<p>“She don’t live anywhere round here,” he
said; “I know all the kids in this neighborhood,
and I never laid eyes on her before. She’s got
good clothes on; looks as if she might have come
over from the West Side.”</p>

<p>Peter edged his way nearer to the counter.
The little figure lay so very still that he was beginning
to feel uncomfortable. He would just
take one look, and then run away. Suddenly he
uttered an exclamation of astonishment, and
turned excitedly to the interested spectators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>“Hello! Oh, I say! I know who she is; I’ve
seen her before.”</p>

<p>“Where does she live?” half a dozen voices
inquired at once, and all eyes were turned upon
the excited Peter.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Peter, looking very much bewildered,
“it’s the funniest thing I ever knew.
I can’t make out what she was doing around here.
My sister used to work for her folks; their name
is Marsh, and they live away down Broadway,
opposite the opera house.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>FROM SHADOW TO SUNSHINE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SOME one was playing the Swan song from
“Lohengrin”; it was very beautiful, but
it sounded so far away. Gretel wanted to
get nearer to the music. She tried to rise, but
there was such a heavy weight on her feet that
she could not move. Then the music changed to
the roar of an elevated train, and she felt the hot
sun beating down upon her head. Oh, how terribly
hot it was, and she was so thirsty, too. If
some one would only give her a drink of water,
but when she tried to ask for it her tongue refused
to form the words. The cruel sun was burning
her up. There must be shade somewhere. She
would cross the street and try to find it, but what
would become of her bag? She was too tired to
carry it any longer. How those elevated trains
roared. She was afraid to move, yet she must
get into the shade. She made another feeble
effort to move, and then something soft and cool
was laid on her forehead, and a voice that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
sounded as if it came from a great way off
said—</p>

<p>“Lie still, dear; you are quite safe here.”</p>

<p>Gretel tried to explain about the sun, but the
words would not come right, and she gave it up
in despair. She liked the soft, cool thing on her
forehead, but the trouble was it did not stay cool
long enough. Everything was hot, burning hot.
If somebody would only give her some cold water
to drink, but when at last, a glass was held to
her lips, and she tried to swallow, the water, like
everything else, seemed hot, and it did not quench
her thirst.</p>

<p>There was pain, too, dreadful pain all over her,
and every time she tried to move into a more
comfortable position, some force seemed to hold
her still. At last she found that she could speak,
and then she began to call piteously for Percy
and Barbara; Jerry and Geraldine; and Higgins,
but nobody answered—nobody seemed to understand.
She could see faces—so many faces—but
there was not one among them, that she knew.
Once she was sure she heard some one crying,
and for a moment she thought it was Barbara,
but when she looked again a strange face was
bending over her, and a lady dressed in white,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
with a cap on her head, was offering her something
to drink.</p>

<p>Gradually she began to remember things in a
vague, confused way. She remembered going
to New York on the train, and trying to find the
Lipheims. Was she still in the street, she wondered?
If so, it had grown strangely quiet and
cool. She was no longer burning up, only she
was so very tired. She must have walked a long
way, and then—what had happened? There
had been a great noise of shouting, and something
big had come terribly close to her, and after that
she did not remember any more.</p>

<p>While she was still pondering on this subject,
in a weak, half conscious way, some one bent
over her, and she saw again the lady in the white
dress and cap. The lady did not speak, but she
smiled, and her smile was pleasant, and somehow
reassuring. Then she put something that looked
like a tube under Gretel’s tongue, and when she
took it out again, she looked pleased, and said to
some one, the little girl could not see—</p>

<p>“She is much better; the fever has gone down
to a hundred and one. That is a great gain over
yesterday.”</p>

<p>Gretel wanted to say that she understood, and
to ask some questions, but she was so tired that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
seemed easier just to lie still with her eyes shut.
She drifted off into a dream, in which she seemed
to hear Percy and Barbara talking about
“Lohengrin.”</p>

<p>“Poor little girl; poor little kiddie.” Yes,
that was surely Percy’s voice, and it did not sound
angry either, only very sorry. Gretel did not
open her eyes, but she tried to remember things.
Why was her brother sorry, and why had she expected
him to be angry? It was something—about—about
being a dishonest person. Ah, she
remembered all about it now, and with a sharp
little cry, she started up, fully conscious at last.</p>

<p>“I stole Barbara’s ticket to fairy-land,” she
wailed. “Percy said I was a dishonest person.
I didn’t mean to be dishonest; I didn’t—I
didn’t!”</p>

<p>“Hush, Gretel darling, lie still; everything is
all right. There, there, don’t cry; see, Percy
and I are here; we have come to take care of our
little girl.”</p>

<p>“Did you get my letter, Barbara?” whispered
Gretel, as she nestled in her sister’s arms, and
gazed lovingly into the sweet face bending over
her.</p>

<p>“Yes, dearest, but, oh, my poor, foolish little
Gretel, how could you do such a dreadful thing as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
to run away and leave us? Didn’t you know
how much Percy and I loved you?”</p>

<p>“I thought you wouldn’t love me any more
when you knew how wicked I had been,” said
Gretel, humbly. “I thought I would go to the
Lipheims, and ask Fritz to get me a place with
those vaudeville people Peter Grubb was going
with, but they had moved, and I couldn’t find
them. Then it got so hot, and I was so dreadfully
tired, and—”</p>

<p>“We know all about it, dear; don’t talk; just
lie still and get well. We won’t leave you until
you are able to come home, and then we shall all
be so happy again.”</p>

<p>“And you are not angry—you really can forgive
me?”</p>

<p>Barbara did not answer in words, but her
kisses and her happy tears were all the assurance
Gretel needed.</p>

<p>“And will Percy forgive me, too?” she whispered
timidly.</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything to forgive, Pussy,” said
Mr. Douane huskily, as he bent to kiss the pale,
wistful little face.</p>

<p>“But I really was a dishonest person,” persisted
Gretel, feverishly; “are you sure you want
a dishonest person to live in your house?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“Quite sure, little girl; home wouldn’t be home
without our Gretel.”</p>

<p>Gretel gave a long sigh of utter content, and
her eyelids drooped. In another moment she had
fallen asleep.</p>

<p>When Gretel awoke after a long, refreshing
nap, her brother had gone away, but Barbara was
still in the room, and she and the lady in the white
cap were having a whispered conversation by the
window. Gretel lay watching them in silence for
several minutes. She was very happy, but she
did not feel much like talking just yet. Slowly
she began to take in the details of her surroundings.
She was in a small, plainly furnished
room, and an electric fan was waving gently over
her bed. She wondered where she could be, but
decided that it did not really matter so long as
Barbara was there, too, and just then her sister-in-law
glanced in her direction, and discovered
that she was awake.</p>

<p>“Where are we, Barbara?” Gretel asked a
few minutes later, when Mrs. Douane was sitting
by her bedside, and the lady in the white cap had
given her something to drink, which tasted very
good.</p>

<p>“We are in a hospital in New York. They
brought you here after your accident.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>“Accident?” repeated Gretel, looking puzzled;
“did I have an accident? Oh, yes, I know; I
was crossing the street, and something very big
came close to me, and then I don’t remember any
more. Was I run over?”</p>

<p>“You were knocked down by a trolley car, and
badly hurt, but you are ever so much better now,
and you will be quite well again soon.”</p>

<p>“How did you and Percy find me?” was
Gretel’s next question. She was beginning to
feel a good deal more interest in things than she
had felt a few hours earlier.</p>

<p>“Why, dearest, it was all quite wonderful. If
I tell you about it will you try to lie still, and
not ask any more questions? The doctor says
you must be kept very quiet or the fever may
come back.”</p>

<p>Gretel promised that she would be very good,
and Mrs. Douane went on to explain.</p>

<p>“When Higgins came to call you, and found
your room empty, she was very much surprised,
especially when she discovered that your suit-case
had also disappeared. Then she saw your
letter on the desk, and went to call Percy and me.
You said you were going to some old friends in
New York, and the only people we could think of
were Mrs. Marsh and her daughter. Percy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
started for New York as soon as he could, and in
the meantime we telephoned Mrs. Marsh, telling
her what had happened, and asking her to communicate
with us the moment you arrived. As
soon as Percy reached the city he went at once to
Mrs. Marsh’s, hoping to find you there, but of
course they knew nothing about you, and he was
just starting off to put the case in the hands of
the police, when a telephone message came, saying
you had been hurt, and were to be taken to this
hospital. And here comes the wonderful part of
the story. When you were lying unconscious in
a drug store, you were recognized by a little boy,
who gave his name as Peter Grubb. He said he
knew where you lived, and gave Mrs. Marsh’s
address to the people at the store, who at once
communicated with us.”</p>

<p>“How very interesting,” said Gretel. “Peter
Grubb was the very person I was trying to find
when I couldn’t find the Lipheims, but I hadn’t
any idea where he lived, except that it was uptown
on the East Side. I thought perhaps he might
be able to tell me how to get into vaudeville. Oh,
Barbara dear, you can’t think what a comfort it
is to know you really don’t mind seeing me again,
even when you know how wicked I was.”</p>

<p>“Why, Gretel, how could you think such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
dreadful things? Percy and I have been here
ever since we heard of your accident, only you
were too ill to know us. It has been a very sad
time, but it is all over now, so shut your eyes, and
try to go to sleep again. I see Miss Simpson is
beginning to look as if she thought I was letting
you talk too much.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was an afternoon a week later, and Gretel
was sitting bolstered up with pillows in the arm-chair
by the window. She was still very pale and
thin, but was gaining strength each day, and that
morning the doctor had removed the last strip of
plaster from her forehead. Miss Simpson—the
white-capped nurse—was reading aloud to her,
and on the table was a big bowl filled with beautiful
roses, which had arrived only an hour before
from Mr. Douane’s place on the Hudson. Gretel
looked the picture of content, as she leaned back
among her pillows, listening to the adventures
of Tom Sawyer. She had grown very fond of
kind Miss Simpson, and her days at the big hospital
had been anything but unpleasant.</p>

<p>A knock at the door brought the reading to a
sudden pause, and in answer to Miss Simpson’s
“Come in,” an official appeared with a card,
which he handed to the nurse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“Some friends have come to see you, Gretel,”
said Miss Simpson, glancing at the card. “I
think they must be the children who sent ‘Tom
Sawyer’; Jerry and Geraldine Barlow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I should love to see them,” cried Gretel,
eagerly. “May they come in, Miss Simpson?”</p>

<p>Miss Simpson said they certainly might, and
that she would go to the reception room, and
bring them herself. She disappeared for a few
moments, and when she returned she was closely
followed by the twins, both looking very much
awed, and almost preternaturally solemn.</p>

<p>At sight of Gretel, with all her hair cut off, and
a big scar over one temple, they became so painfully
embarrassed, that neither of them spoke a
word, and, contrary to the usual order of things,
she was forced to make all the advances.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad to see you both,” she said, cordially.
“Won’t you sit down?”</p>

<p>The twins took the chairs Miss Simpson placed
for them, still in the same embarrassed silence,
and the nurse, thinking the children might feel
more at their ease if left to themselves, went out
of the room, after telling Gretel to ring the little
bell at her side if she wanted anything. Then
Jerry found his tongue, and remarked in his
gruffest tones—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>“We’re ever so glad you’re better.”</p>

<p>“You really are better, aren’t you?” inquired
Geraldine, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, indeed; I’m almost well. I’m to go
home the day after to-morrow. Percy is coming
for me in the automobile. He and Barbara
have stayed here most of the time, but since I’ve
been so much better they have gone home at night.
Barbara was here all this morning; I’m sorry
you didn’t come in time to see her.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been dreadfully ill,” said Geraldine,
solemnly.</p>

<p>“I suppose I was at first, but I didn’t know anything
about how ill I was till I began to get better.”</p>

<p>“Too bad you had to have your hair cut off,”
observed Jerry, in a tone of regret.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Simpson says it will soon grow
again,” Gretel assured him cheerfully. “The
scar on my forehead won’t show so much then
either. It’s rather pleasant to have short hair in
this hot weather. Have you gone to the country
yet?”</p>

<p>“No, but we’re going to-morrow; that’s why
we came to see you this afternoon. Mother
brought us, and she’s coming back in half an hour.
She sent her love.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>“Mother cried about you when you were so
ill,” said Geraldine. “You see, she was afraid
you were going to die. I cried, too, and I think
Jerry did, though he didn’t want anybody to see
him do it.”</p>

<p>“I did not,” declared Jerry, indignantly, and
he grew so red, and looked so uncomfortable that
Gretel hastened to change the subject by saying—</p>

<p>“I want to thank you for all those nice books
you sent. Miss Simpson is reading ‘Tom Sawyer’
to me now, and it’s very interesting.”</p>

<p>“Tom had some fine adventures, didn’t he?”
said Jerry, eagerly. He was very glad to steer
the conversation safely away from the subject of
tears. “I wish we could be lost in a cave, and
go for pirates.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” declared Geraldine, with conviction.
“I think one adventure is quite enough for any
person to have, and I’ve given Mother a solemn
promise never to frighten her again, and I mean
to keep my word.”</p>

<p>“Gretel had a bigger adventure than any of
us,” said Jerry, not without a shade of envy in
his tone. “It must have been awfully exciting
to get knocked down by a trolley car, and be taken
to a hospital in an ambulance, only I shouldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
like to have to stay in bed for such a long time
afterwards.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t go away to have an adventure,”
said Gretel, reddening; “I went because—because—”</p>

<p>“We know,” said Geraldine; “Mrs. Douane
told Mother, and she told us. She talked about
it for a long time one night after we’d said our
prayers.”</p>

<p>“Did she think I was a very dreadful person?”
inquired Gretel, rather tremulously. “I’m afraid
people won’t ever like me any more when they
know how wicked I was, even though Percy and
Barbara have forgiven me, and say they love me
just the same.”</p>

<p>“Mother doesn’t think you at all wicked,” protested
Geraldine; “that isn’t the reason why she
talked to us. She thinks you were very brave to
confess the way you did, and she hopes we should
be just as brave if we ever did anything naughty
that nobody knew about but ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Did your mother really say that?” demanded
Gretel, her face brightening. “You aren’t making
it up just to make me feel comfortable?”</p>

<p>“We don’t tell things that aren’t true,” returned
Geraldine, indignantly, and Jerry added—“Mother
truly did say it, and a lot more, too.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
She’s awfully fond of you, and so is Father.
They were dreadfully worried when they thought
you were—I mean when you were so ill.”</p>

<p>Gretel gave a long happy sigh.</p>

<p>“It’s beautiful to have every one so kind and
forgiving,” she said; “but even if nobody ever
punished me or scolded me, I shall always know
myself how wicked I was.”</p>

<p>Gretel’s pale cheeks had grown suddenly very
pink, but her honest eyes looked straight into her
friends’ as she spoke, and the twins were both
much impressed.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s what Mother means when she
talks about our learning things by experience,”
said Geraldine, with a sudden inspiration. “She
said your punishment was much greater than if
you had been deprived of things, or locked in your
room. It was all because of your conscience, you
know. I think consciences are rather horrid
things, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“But suppose you hadn’t told; nobody would
ever have known anything about it,” said Jerry
reflectively.</p>

<p>“I had to tell,” said Gretel, simply. “It was
Barbara’s ticket, and she and Percy were being
good to me every minute. You would have told,
too, Jerry, I know you would.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>Jerry looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’d have felt pretty mean if I
hadn’t,” he admitted. “I wonder if the Law of
Love isn’t the best way, after all. It makes you
feel so ashamed when you’re not punished for
things you know you ought to be.”</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” chimed in Geraldine;
“Mother always knows the best way of doing
things. But she doesn’t read those books any
more. She says she thinks she’s found out how
to do it herself. I guess the Mind Cure is all
right too. Perhaps if we’d kept on believing we
wouldn’t have been seasick that day, we might
have been all right. Anyhow, God took care of
us when we asked Him to, and he took care of
Gretel.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed He did!” cried Gretel, with
shining eyes. “Just think how wonderful it all
was. If Peter Grubb hadn’t happened to be right
there, nobody would have known where I was,
and Percy and Barbara might never have found
me. We are all very grateful to Peter. Barbara
found out where he lived, and went to see his
mother. She brought them all some cream-puffs,
because I told her how very fond Lillie was of
them, and they were so pleased. Peter didn’t get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
taken into the vaudeville company after all.
They didn’t think he had enough talent. Now he
thinks he’ll be either a fireman or a boy scout instead.
But the nicest part of it all is that Barbara
has engaged Dora to be our chambermaid.
Dora is so happy, for she says she has never had a
really good place, and she hates being a maid-of-all-work.
I’m so glad I’m going to see her
again, for she was the first person who was kind
to me at Mrs. Marsh’s.”</p>

<p>The children chatted on for another fifteen
minutes, and then Miss Simpson came to tell them
their mother had called for them, and the friends
had to say good-by.</p>

<p>“But it won’t be for so very long,” said Gretel,
cheerfully. “You know you are coming to make
us a long visit in September. It’s almost July
now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’m going to write you a long letter
every week all summer,” promised Geraldine,
resolutely choking down a rising lump in her
throat. “Mother says if we read a little history,
and write a letter to somebody every day, we
needn’t have any more lessons till we come back
to New York. Isn’t that splendid? We were
so afraid we were going to have another old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
teacher. Not that Miss Heath was really old, but
then, you see, we don’t care much for teachers,
except when they’re not teaching.”</p>

<p>“What are you thinking of, Gretel?” Miss
Simpson asked, with a smile, as she brought her
little patient a glass of milk, when the visitors had
gone. “You look as if you were very happy
about something.”</p>

<p>“I am,” said Gretel, softly. “I was just
thinking how many lovely people there are in the
world, and how beautiful it is to be loved.”</p>
